			</strong>Some creatures look cuddly, and are. Some, though, look 
			cuddly and definitely are not.<br>
			<br>
			One evening a week or so ago I sat in my van at the far 
			north-western tip of this beautiful island, shining in gorgeous 
			weather, and watched a black bear destroy the inside (yes -- the 
			inside) of a new-looking Toyota that had driven across the continent 
			from Quebec to visit Cape Scott, a spectacular wilderness area 
			reached on weary feet through mud and primeval rain-coast forest.<br>
			<br>
			It&#39;s one of the adventure pilgrimages here. The only way to get 
			there after the road ends is by Shanks&#39;s pony, carrying your own 
			food and survival gear through ancient wetland and dense forest of yellow 
			and red cedar, hemlock and&nbsp; some of the most magnificent 
			giant spruce trees on the planet. For a lone foot-slogger the scope 
			of the place, strange with the bright green moss of humid, silent 
			forest, is rivetting. Size, inaccessable terrain and the unknown 
			round each turn of the rough, muddy track across a network of 
			slippery tree-roots, make you feel rather small and vulnerable. 
			Besides bears there are cougars and wolves to raise the tension that 
			little bit extra. Unarmed, all you have to deal with a marauding 
			beast is a pepper spray, your wits and a good speech (there&#39;s 
			nothing like preparing a few sharp words).<br>
			<br>
			Anyway -- I drove my Ford van the 500-odd kilometres from Brentwood, 
			down here by Victoria, to the timber and fishing town of Port Hardy 
			up north, veered off onto 50 kilometres of gravel logging road and 
			arrived, sliding round bends in a cloud of red, sandy dust at the 
			settlement of Holberg, deep at the head of a beautiful Pacific 
			inlet. Most of the names round here -- Nissen Bight, Nels Bight, 
			Hansen Lagoon -- are Danish. In the early 1900&#39;s a hundred or so 
			hardy Danish settlers established an agricultural and fishing 
			community. Traces are all around. It failed because communications 
			didn&#39;t enable the settlers to get their produce out to market. 
			(Actually, it failed because the Canadian government took fright at 
			the Danes&#39; successful establishment of a separate, vigorous 
			community and failed to build a promised road).<br>
			<br>
			So here I am at the trailhead, sitting in my van, when a black bear 
			(there are said to be no grizzlies on Vancouver Island, though 
			stories suggest that isn&#39;t necessarily true. They&#39;re good swimmers) 
			-- when a black bear emerges from the forest and comes right up. 
			Bold with the brass of the total novice, I open the van door, tell 
			it to go away -- and it runs. (They run at the speed of race-horses 
			-- up trees as well -- which sort of limits your escape plan. And 
			the other myths about bears not seeing or hearing very well are just 
			that -- myths. Moreover, when it comes to smelling, few animals are 
			as sharp as bears. Everything from honey to stinking garbage. 
			200-pound cuddly buggers with appetite about sums them up).<br>
			<br>
			However -- the bear scarpers and I think I&#39;d better root around in 
			the van for my camera in case I see another (little do I know yet 
			how many there are around San Josef!). Next when I look up the 
			bear&#39;s back -- this time on the roof of the Toyota parked not 20 
			feet away. Then it&#39;s down on the ground rocking the car &#39;till I 
			think it&#39;s going to go over. Then there&#39;s a cloud of flying glass as 
			it punches through a rear side window and climbs in to start the 
			havoc among food containers, coolboxes and poly bags, tearing and 
			flinging them around inside and outside the car (in disgust at cheap 
			brands, I wonder?) and tearing up the interior trim. It&#39;s 
			impressively untidy. The car-park&#39;s strewn with more half-chewed 
			food litter than you&#39;d imagine could possibly be packed into a car. It would have been kinder 
			to the car to have 
			tossed a stick of gelignite in.<br>
			<br>
			At this point I recall what I&#39;ve been told about bears getting stuck 
			on food fads and decide discretion is by far the better part of 
			valour, so I retreat in my van to Doug Desjarlais&#39; place a kilometre 
			back down the track. To cut a long story short, after much debating 
			with Doug (a remarkable and very friendly man, Metis-descended, who 
			lives alone on his &#39;heritage&#39; camp-site in a wooden hut full of 
			computers and assorted tackle) I spend the night&nbsp; (very 
			comfortably in the fitted bed) in the van, park it outside Doug&#39;s 
			place with all the van curtains drawn so the bears can&#39;t see what&#39;s 
			inside -- but see later!) and set off yomping alone into the jungle 
			next morning. It&#39;s 17.8 kilometres to where I&#39;m headed at Nels 
			Bight, a beautiful white sandy beach adjacent to the point of Cape 
			Scott. My rucksack, fully geared, weighs about 40 pounds -- and 
			feels it. No pain, no gain, as they say. After last night&#39;s show I&#39;m 
			rather more alert about predatory animals but my powerful pepper 
			spray&#39;s at the ready on my hip belt, with the safety catch off. I 
			practice drawing it like lightning, right-hand across the chest, 
			Clint Eastwood style. Come on, bears! (I also did a trial shot at 
			home before I left. It shoots out a wicked red wedge of pepper, 
			effective at 30 feet, with the recoil of a small-calibre hand-gun. 
			And woe betide if you dally around. I -- the shooter -- was blind 
			with streaming eyes for a full ten minutes. Which I assume leaves 
			two of us, me and the bear, staggering around blindly on the same 
			spot).<br>
			<br>
			Seven weary hours later, I&#39;m on the beach at Nels Bight. It&#39;s quite 
			simply beautiful. I pitch my Hubba Hubba (that&#39;s my two-man tent) in 
			the sand at the head of the beach beyond the tide-line. They&#39;re neap 
			tides right now, so I calculate (correctly!) the next tide won&#39;t 
			reach me during the night. I get my stove and a cup of tea going, 
			eat a couple of pre-cooked Red Barn turkey sausages, a bagel and a 
			handful of nuts and raisins and decide there and then I&#39;m going to 
			eat a shed-load tomorrow so I don&#39;t have to carry it back.&nbsp; I 
			needn&#39;t have worried over-much. Because of the bear problem, and 
			their facility for smelling out the faintest culinary whiff, you&#39;re 
			admonished never to leave food in your tent. Or even cook in your 
			tent. Instead you pack it all up and lock it inside a steel food 
			cache. They&#39;re dotted about. <br>
			Which is what I did. No bear touched my food. The mice got it.<br>
			<br>
			Soon I&#39;m&nbsp; bedded comfortably in my down sleeping bag. 
			There&#39;s little wind, only the hum and swish of the Pacific coming 
			ashore. Miraculously (though I did watch the weatherfaxes for a 
			decent window) there&#39;s no sign of rain in the wettest of spots in 
			British Columbia -- 330 centimetres on average each year. <br>
			<br>
			It&#39;s 
			mid-morning when I surface. There are bear paw-marks all around the 
			tent. Early Pacific coast fog has cleared, it&#39;s a cloudless sky, 
			white rollers are hitting the empty, mile-long white sand beach.&nbsp; 
			It&#39;s another brilliant, brilliant day in paradise, far from 
			recession and gloom.<br>
			<br>
			Another night in the ranger&#39;s cabin, welcomingly left empty and 
			fully-equipped on the edge of Nels Bight -- what a view! -- with a 
			couple of other similar back-packing souls arriving, then back 
			through the forest, 19 kilometres this time, to the trailhead. I&#39;m 
			bushed, of course -- but I&#39;ve done it. It&#39;s all a mind-game. It 
			always amazes me how easy the last kilometre is, when you&#39;re in 
			sight of the goal. <br>
			<br>
			But I&#39;m sweating; if not at the physical effort, at the news brought 
			by my hiking friends at Nels Bight that another vehicle has been 
			wrecked by two bears. By now I&#39;ve remembered that I forgot to draw 
			the curtains on my van&#39;s sliding side door. There&#39;s a shiver at what 
			destruction I might find. <br>
			<br>
			I see with relief when it comes into view outside Doug&#39;s hut that 
			everything&#39;s OK. The beer&#39;s in the coolbox. I knock the top off and 
			gulp it with the manners of a black bear.<br>
			A short while down the road at Holberg I meet Doug again and friends in the 
			pub for a meal (Holberg logger size). The marauding bears have been shot dead. There&#39;s no uneducating them. But it&#39;s still sad.<strong>
			</strong>I never saw any cougars, or wolves. It&#39;s a fair bet they 
			saw me, though.<br>
			<strong>
			<br>
			</strong>What next? Nootka Island, on Vancouver Island&#39;s wild west 
			coast, perhaps. Where Captain James Cook landed in the 1770&#39;s and 
			started it all.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Best wishes,<br>
			Ian</strong><br>
