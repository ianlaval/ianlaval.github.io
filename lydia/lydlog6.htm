        -- we finally made it. After a rollicking start out of the Chesapeake
        this morning, helped by outgoing tide and a sunny breeze on the port
        bow, we're now in the Atlantic heading for England. We escaped<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>with a typical east coast American thunderstorm on our tail,
        making over seven knots out to sea on the edge of the squall wind. But
        it didn't last. The wind's died and we're down to a couple of knots or
        less, drifting north with the Gulf Stream. Overhead we're getting
        numerous displays of American airforce and navy power -- the
        Chesapeake's the US navy's home. The sun's out, it's pleasant and we've
        just eaten our first supper at sea -- stewed everything prepared in
        advance in the pressure cooker. At least Lydia B's giving us a gentle
        entry into the ocean while we find our sea legs again. I've no doubt
        that somewhere along the next 3200 miles to Maryport we'll run into much
        harder weather.<o:p>

        now, though, it's goodbye to the United States. We spent our last US
        dollars yesterday on lunch at Salt Ponds marina, a little way up the
        Chesapeake from Hampton, where we went to replace Lydia's starter
        battery. When we got there we found we didn't need it. The current
        battery's fine, save for a faulty connection. But the marina was
        hospitality itself, offering us free dockage and showers for a few
        hours. It's useful being British here since Iraq.<o:p>

        if ever there was an easy way to start an Atlantic crossing, this was
        it. We had a quiet night aboard Lydia B, tramping quietly along with no
        more than a fitful ten-knot breeze on the starboard beam. Still, we
        covered 103 miles in our first 24 hours out of the Chesapeake before the
        wind died to barely a breath just before first light and a new system
        picked up from the south-west. We've both had some useful sleep, eaten,
        shaved and the rest and are back up to 6 knots right now in a freshening
        breeze and bright sun. A new weatherfax from Boston says we're about in
        the right position, going due east just below the 37th parallel. A cold
        front chasing us from ashore will probably give us a lively time when it
        arrives sometime in the next 48 hours, but a gale system a few hundred
        miles ahead seems to be moving southwards out of our way.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We've
        been dodging US warships all night. Streams of them -- returning from
        Iraq? -- have been passing us in-bound.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Well,
        no sooner than we'd remarked what an easy entry to the Atlantic we'd
        had, we were on deck yesterday dragging sail down as the first of a
        series of thunderstorms arrived. It was quite a show. Lightning for
        miles and ugly skies all along the horizon. Plus, of course, the sudden
        inrush of wind and heavy rain as cold air met warm. It's nothing unusual
        around here. Thunderstorms are common here most summer afternoons --
        though we'd thought that 150 miles out to sea we'd be beginning to leave
        them behind.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">So
        we spent the rest of the night double-reefed and with a staysail up,
        pottering along in a fitful, increasing ocean swell, and little woind.
        Everything that could clatter, above and below deck, clattered . Still,
        our second day of miles covered is another 96. We should beat that with
        the current run. Today we found an east-bound offshoot current of the
        Gulf Stream pushing us along at bonus two knots. That, plus a following
        20-knot westerly, means we've been bowling along all day at a leisurely
        seven knots and above. It's been sunny and the ocean's that incredible
        deep blue, uncontaminated by land. We've heard no traffic on the VHF all
        day, nor have we seen another boat. We've just put the first reef in the
        main for today's thunderstorm edition. Dave's at the helm, ready with
        his foulies on. For supper, we thought tortillas and something. Total
        haul from yesterday's fishing exploits was a bunch of seaweed.<o:p>

        of day four and Lydia B's now 322 miles out from the US east coast,
        still hugging latitude 37N. The sun's up, a 10-15 knot breeze on the
        starboard beam's freshening and we're reaching eastwards under full
        cutter rig at a steady 6 to 7 knots and more. I'm glad I bought the new
        -- second-hand -- staysail before we left Virginia. It's slightly bigger
        than Lydia's old one, better shaped and much stronger. She just loves
        driving with a staysail up.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Dave's
        in his bunk, catching up on sleep after coming off watch at daybreak and
        listening to Radio Canada International's transmission of Stuart Maclean
        and The Vinyl Cafe; I'm on the computer at the nav station and Lydia's
        happily sailing herself with the Monitor servo-pendulum steering system.
        We do little except tweak the wind-vane now and again, at either a
        wind-shift or a gust, to which the boat responds with weather-helm. I'm
        being surprised at Lydia's turn of speed after weighing into the water
        at Deltaville at almost 17,000 pounds -- and a clean bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        split the night into two halves, with me taking the first stint. Not
        much happened in the dark hours (which really aren't dark but star-lit
        down to the horizon, even without a moon), with the southerly breeze
        doing little more than maintaining a presence, not really enough to stop
        us slopping and slatting in the troughs. Before midnight a freighter
        came up three miles astern close to our track. I switched on a few more
        lights and called him on the VHF to make sure he knew we were there. A
        Russian--sounding<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>voice
        replied, asked us to go to channel 10, went silent and then the boat
        stopped and disappeared. We don't know why, but haven't seen it since.
        The ocean looks pretty empty now.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The
        VHF's permanently switched on channel 16, the hailing and emergency
        channel. Two days ago we listened to the skipper of a fishing boat off
        the North Carolina coast shouting a 'may-day' with an engine-room fire.
        Then.... &quot;I can't get out.....!!&quot; and nothing more. Several
        hours later the US coast guard reported finding the vessel, but we know
        no more.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Alas
        -- when I pulled in the fishing line we've been trailing -- no lure. The
        big squid and hook had gone, a swivel having been burst open. A big
        fish? Of course! I've put out a bright gold-and-silver spoon in its
        place.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Morning's
        the best time on Lydia. When the night and its sleeplessness is over,
        the ocean's bright blue again and it's time for coffee and breakfast, to
        do a few tidying chores and generally freshen up. Then shake out any
        overnight reefs, trim the sails, clean up a little below, check progress
        across the ocean on all our information sources -- GPS, radio and
        weatherfax -- and get the ship generally under control. <o:p>

        never stop being amazed out here on the ocean. At its size and moods.
        How friendly and familiar it often is, and how quickly it can change
        from gentle blue to warning grey. You take advantage of what it offers
        and do what it tells you to do. Far from thousands of miles of sameness,
        each mile is like crossing an interesting new place.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Well,
        shortly after sending Saturday's jolly little message about pleasant
        life aboard Lydia B on the ocean blue, we got our come-uppance (which is
        the reason for the brevity of my last log entry.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Shortly
        after I sent it off into the afternoon sunshine we were overtaken by the
        MV Oleander, a freighter heading from Bermuda to Newfoundland. Clearly
        himself a Newfie himself, going by his Irish-Canadian accent, he called
        us on the VHF. For a chat, we thought. But it was really to ask if we
        were aware of the weather ahead on our easterly track. 20-30 knots of
        wind and 8 -14 foot seas east of N70, he said. Right on our doorstep.
        We'd be uncomfortable for a night, then high pressure would build on the
        other side of this system. We felt we could handle 20-30 knots of wind.
        Even 14-foot seas (though they really wouldn't happen. Would they?
        Realists just wouldn't go voyaging).<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">That
        night we got caught in the strongest weather we ever want to see.
        Southerly winds were soon screaming and seas building. We hove to,
        already down to second (and last) reef and storm jib. The sight and the
        noise were extraordinary. Big seas began to pile up, streaked with blown
        foam. Lydia B, with its crew anxiously listening for sounds of
        moderation, spent the whole night on her beam-ends, stationary except
        for a northerly drift of about 1.5 knots. Breaking waves regularly
        crashed over her. She was so far down that we watched solid water
        flowing over the starboard portholes. How on earth could she take it?<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We
        got little sleep. It was a bleak time, in darkness. At first light, with
        the storm still as hearty as ever, we tied ourselves to the boat and
        crawled up the deck in driving rain to drag down the reefed main and get
        the boat more upright. Then we did the same to the storm jib. Lydia B
        then lay a-hull in more or less the same place, with the rudder lashed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Then we found water coming in and, unable to trace the source --
        the bilge was still dry -- we sent out a Pan-Pan on the HF radio, unsure
        if it had been heard. Then we discovered that the boat had been pushed
        so far down hove-to that it had simply come in over the top. It stopped
        when we brought her upright.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">By
        this time Lydia B is in chaos below, everything moveable having flown --
        including a topless jar of coffee-creamer. Coffee-creamer turns to
        toffee when sea-water is applied. It makes a wonderful slide on a
        varnished cabin sole.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">A
        couple of hours after first light we got a call from Tony, English
        skipper of 'Wings of Time', a 50-ft ketch about a mile from us, on
        passage from Bermuda to Maine, NE USA. He'd clocked a wind of 61 knots
        during the night, with the remainder steady at 50 knots. We know he's
        right. We cancelled our Pan-Pan on the HF and got Tony to contact a ham
        radio colleague in Bermuda to phone the coast guard in Canada and the US
        in case our original message had been heard. It probably wasn't.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Two
        hours later we put the still screeching southerly back on Lydia's
        starboard beam, started the engine and motored back into the Gulf
        Stream, still offering a 2.6-knot ride on our easterly heading. By now,
        the seas had really risen to classic Atlantic height. We spent all
        yesterday rushing along with current and wind -- we did the last 30
        miles to 4.0am this morning under bare pole, with neither engine nor
        sail power, but still running at up to eight knots. Lydia's eight tons
        picked up and hoisted to the top of a newly forming wave. Then the wave
        foams at its height, sometimes breaking, Lydia dips her stern, then her
        bow goes down and she takes off downhill into the next trough. Time and
        again a cross-wave chases Lydia, breaks on her gunwale and crashes
        aboard, filling the cockpit (and occasionally knocking down Dave or
        myself, tethered to the boat). The scene is impossible to describe. By
        then there was blue sky and sun, so these gigantic waves, with
        foam-streaked troughs between them something the size of a ski-run, and
        the height to match, were blue too. Awesome's the word. And awesome that
        little Lydia B survived -- though we felt constantly secure in her. She
        needs some tlc below (we probably don't smell too sweet by this time
        either); her cockpit lee-cloths were torn to shreds by the sheer force
        of the wind. We lost a few items blown out of the cockpit but otherwise
        she's fit and well. <o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">It's
        been the toughest imaginable entry to offshore sailing for Dave, who's
        had a bad dose of debilitating sea-sickness.<o:p>

        the wind's calmed and we're sailing again, happy with five docile knots
        and nearing the outer wall of the Gulf Stream. We're 560 nautical miles
        out of the US east coast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        so many thanks for all your concerns and good wishes over the last
        couple of days. We knew very few boats were near during the storm, but
        were thankful to be in touch with you. Today it's sunny again, there's a
        warm breeze of about ten knots on Lydia's starboard quarter and the
        ocean's back to its familiar alluring, sparkling blue. We've both had
        sleep, are eating again and are ambling along, still under storm jib and
        reefed main, at four or so knots. The ocean's calming down. Seas are
        down to eight feet. It'll take a while for the storm swell to subside. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We're
        dropping south-east to get under 37 degrees North and out of the
        influence of the series of low pressure systems that spawned our big one
        two days ago. The barometer's already risen and we're coming under the
        influence of the Azores high. When we've slipped another half degree
        south, to 36, we'll head due east. From there we hear from Herb, an
        amateur who runs an HF radio net daily for Atlantic sailors, that
        weather prospects for Europe-bound boats are good at least until the end
        of the week.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Today,
        rather than pile on more sail immediately, we'll give Lydia B the rest
        she deserves. And ourselves. We got no sleep and little food, and are
        sore from banging about inside the lurching boat. Like living inside a
        washing machine, said a colleague ashore. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The
        tally of loss and damage is small: a dinghy oar, outboard fuel and a
        two-gallon can of water washed from the side decks. The lee cloths
        shredded, a cockpit sheet bag gone and -- much the greatest loss -- the
        top of my Nissan insulated mug, which got sucked out when the cockpit
        filled up. This is serious. Tea and my Nissan are of major importance.
        No damage to the boat, sails or rigging is evident; all the nav gear's
        working and the Monitor self-steering's intact, save for a battered vane
        (I have three spares) -- though Dave spotted and repaired a control line
        that had nearly chafed through in the storm.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">But
        how short is the memory! It was awesome while it lasted, and looked like
        a place human beings shouldn't be. But Lydia B took care of us, we must
        have done some right things and it's just great to be out here. Dave's
        sea-sickness is on the wane, his confidence is rising in the light of
        experience and we'll get cracking again shortly. As things stand we've
        maintained an average of 110 miles daily and are content, even though
        the last 24 hours has been fifty percent in a slightly less useful
        direction. We only want to get there, not just fast. From here we
        understand better what drove Bernard Moitessier as he described it in
        &quot;The Long Way&quot;. Not content with completing a racing circuit
        of the world, he kept on going past the finishing line, starting a
        second time round to everyone's consternation ashore. The ocean's a box
        of questions and magical tricks. It's a pity so few people get to look
        inside.<o:p>

        news is good news. Nothing's happening. The wind died completely late
        last night, so we dowsed sail and lay a-hull, wallowing in the ocean,
        for a few hours. By sunrise a gentle southerly had awoken and soon we
        were bowling along under spinnaker, blue sky and warm 15kt breeze.
        Yesterday was a rest day while we dropped gently south. Right now Lydia
        B's headed due east, skirting the low pressure systems to the north,
        where there's another gale brewing, and riding the south-westerlies on
        their southern edge. We've probably lost a few miles from our daily
        average with this dip in our course, but there's plenty of time to catch
        up. It's fascinating getting to understand the weather systems in the
        Atlantic. So far we've covered 769nm since leaving the United States, a

        nautical miles out of the US east coast -- that's about a quarter of the
        way. We're hoping it's the most exciting quarter. We've now sailed far
        enough east to come within the influence of the Azores high pressure
        system. It's good to see the barometer up, and staying up. For now, it
        means sunshine, warmth and less chance of a passing gale. We have 20
        knots of steady wind on the starboard quarter and quite boisterous,
        eight-foot seas. So we've kept the overnight mainsail reef in, plus the
        new staysail and are plodding eastwards at five-and-a-half knots. A
        west-setting current of two knots delayed us last night; we could find
        no reference to it on either American or British Atlantic pilot charts,
        nor did a passing container ship we called up offer any further
        enlightenment. Just nature at work.<o:p>

        to today's problems. Only one, really. A blocked head (toilet, that is).
        Now that might seem small beer to you folks ashore, but believe me,
        availability of an unblocked head on a boat in the middle of a bumpy
        ocean is supremely inmportant. It was blocked all yesterday, so today we
        just had to get down to clearing it. I can't, out of sheer politeness,
        go into details. Nothing to do with etiquette, more a question of
        fascinating science. Except to say there's an entry in Lydia B's log, in
        Dave's own handwriting, that says (please excuse this coarse bit of
        seamen's language) &quot;Dave banned from sh....r.&quot; You'll have to
        ask Dave. It's OK now, I'm happy to say. And that's REALLY happy.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">We
        had a little more encouragement with the fishing business, too. We've
        been trailing a line for the last couple of days. Today I watched a
        10-lb tuna flying through the air to dive on the gold-and-silver spoon,
        gobble it and stretch the bungee attaching the line to the boat to its
        limit. We both sprang out of out of head-janitor mode and started

        reminder of our escape from the storm three days ago. A searching US
        coastguard aircraft called us on the VHF to ask if we'd seen anything of
        a 45-foot sailing vessel called Christina. It had put out an HF radio
        distress call around the time of the storm and hasn't been seen since.
        We hadn't, we said, though we'd just passed through the search area. At

        Briefly: Lydia's bowling along latitude 35, keeping her head under the
        parapet while a gale spends itself a few degrees further north. We're
        getting smarter by the day and spending more time on the weatherfaxes.
        We've just achieved 1,000 nautical miles out of the US and making about
        110nm a day. Today's been uneventful. There's a 20 knot southerly, clear
        sky and sun, I'm just getting ready to prepare supper (potatoes, cabbage
        and whatever meat we can find in the lockers) and things are just dandy

        pressure system, which is now weakening a little. A gale system to the
        north is keeping pace with us along latitude 40N, so were staying down
        at 35N until we have to head up to the Azores somewhere before 40N --

        coastal northeastern US, I think) who's an amateur weather expert (and
        clearly a sailor) who shepherd's sailing boats through various bits of
        the north Atlantic. He co-ordinates the Southbound 2 net for a couple of
        hours each day, steering sailors around potentially difficult weather
        areas and towards the better winds. We haven't actually checked in yet
        but listen in each day. Several boats are near us, heading for the
        Azores,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>so we benefit from
        Herb's information to them. It's a free service, using single sideband
        radio, and is enormously informed about weather. If you want to know
        what dedication is, listen to Herb. He's there on the dot, talking to
        his flock of 60 or so boats at a time. We've only seen one other sailing
        vessel, but we know we're not alone out here.<o:p>

        own weather picture: 20 knots of wind astern. We tracked north a little
        overnight to get nearer the low pressure system to the north and pick up
        a little more wind. Having got it, we've been running all day, partly
        with twin headsails goosewinged, plus the full main. Just our luck to
        have got into a counter-current for part of the day. That cost us a knot
        or more. But Lydia's chugging along. It's damp below; everything's
        salt-laden and the place no longer smells of roses. But we're chugging

        of a trough. It's a big place, is the chief message. There's not a thing
        in sight. Nevertheless it's extraordinarily impressive in this benign
        state, with deep blue water as far as you can see in the
        middle-of-the-day sun. And not at all hostile. It'll send us a wind in
        its own time. After a couple of hours rolling about in the swell, sails
        slatting back and forth, we started the engine to recharge Lydia's
        batteries and motored on eastwards. We've been using battery power
        faster than the wind generator and solar panel is replacing it. <o:p>

        water and land on Lydia B during the night -- I believe they're
        generally trying to escape other fish predators) and what I think are
        called sailfish. These are about six inches long and look like bits of
        blown-up bubble-wrap. I think the idea is that they inflate themselves
        into a sail and the wind blows them over the ocean. They look like toys
        that somebody's dropped overboard. Rather clever, don't you think! You
        might want to check on that one in class. By the way, the ocean here is
        nearly three miles deep beneath Lydia B. I'm still keeping my eyes

        we finally gave up trying to sail with no wind at dusk last night. We
        dowsed the cruising chute, hardened the staysail to keep Lydia headed
        upwind, parked in the ocean and went to bed, rolling clumsily in the
        dying swell. Four hours later, at 0500gmt, we awoke to a new motion. The
        rolling had stopped and I could hear water gurgling past the hull. A new
        wind had arrived and Lydia B took off on her own, going northeast off
        our easterly track. Dave slumbered on, but the early morning scene was
        one to remember. As the yellowing moon sank onto our western horizon the
        new day's sun, streaked with thin cloud of a new pressure system, was
        reddening the dawn sky in the east across calmed but still heaving, oily
        sea. Sun, earth and moon nearly in line. That powerful, mysterious time

        day since then, with a new south-west wind on the right side of the
        weather front that killed yesterday's northwest breeze, we've been
        creaming along under full cutter rig, Lydia B climbing again and again
        onto her bow-wave trying to escape her hull-speed. We bless the
        uncomplaining Monitor. It's kept us faithfully on course with no more
        than an occasional tweak of the control lines. I've no doubt we'll pay
        with tougher times on the run north from the Azores to the Channel
        approaches and England -- a wicked-looking low's been hovering off

        going faster with new winds, we were overtaken by the first sailing
        vessel we've seen since leaving the Chesapeake, a French catamaran bound
        for Narbonne on the Mediterranean. We had a brief chat in French on the
        VHF and promised to pass greetings to a colleague in the Azores. <o:p>

        94 miles added to the tally. We're now 1,785 miles out from the US,
        about another 750 to the Azores (where I think we're going to spend a

        better today -- day 20. The total's now 1,962 miles covered, so we're

        good evening from a lumpy, frustrating Atlantic sea that's doing nothing
        to speed us on our approach to the Azores. To tell the truth, it's been
        a lovely day: unbroken sun, warm temperature with just a hint of welcome
        northern freshness in it, 15 knot breeze. Perfect for sailing -- that
        is, in any direction but Horta. We clawed northwards all last night to
        get away from this north-easter, left behind by yesterday's passing high
        pressure ridge. But alas, we couldn't quite make enough headway and
        found ourselves trapped with wind solidly on the nose. We tried
        sacrificing some of our precious easting to head west of north, only
        confirming after a couple of hours with tight rigging on our beam ends
        slamming through waves in a rolling swell that gentlemen really should
        not go to windward. So we started the motor today to help the sails and
        have resumed our track to the Azores, now less than 200 miles
        north-east. The word (Herb's word, that is) is that the wind should
        begin<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>to back north-west

        tonight because the light's gone out, corroded by constant dousing in
        Atlantic salt. By this time we feel slightly corroded ourselves. <o:p>

        no hot water in the showers, the shower doesn't drain, the shower-room's
        awash with water on the floor, the official soap doesn't work. The
        streets are cobbled, the cars little and they drive very fast. People
        speak a strange language. I don't know about Euros. I'm on firm land. A
        little wobbly after 22 days at sea, but on terra firma. It's heaven.
        European heaven, Portugese style. I haven't a ghost of a complaint to
        make.<o:p>

        totally to another seafaring, colonial era centuries ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Land feels funny after three weeks at sea but the whisky and
        ginger went down fine. If I could give Lydia B one I'd do so. She's been
        spectacular and taken care of us in tough ocean sailing conditions.
        We're now two and a half thousand miles from Deltaville, Virginia and
        there are 11,100 nautical miles on the clock since leaving Victoria BC
        via the Pacific and Central America some 20 months ago.<o:p>

        gone to try his legs out ashore and I expect we'll have a meal shortly.
        The Azores are astonishingly beautiful, in a volcanic way; Horta's
        narrow streets are the neatest place (especially with the prospect of
        real food, water without salt and a laundry). Most especially for me,
        after four years as a guest in North America, the impact of being in a
        European culture again is immense. Horta is old, Portuguese and
        European. The senses and reference points are chaotic. It's all utterly
        fascinating. It justifies all the struggles of the last three weeks at
        sea -- including the storm.<o:p>
