        Canyon, Arizona, Thurs.</b></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,
        Friends:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">If
        ever you thought Americans didn't have a sense of humour, try travelling
        Arizona's Route 66. That's the back road&nbsp; -- the first
        federally-built highway -- that migrating thousands took from Oklahoma
        to California over a century ago. These days it's sidelined by
        Interstate 40; but what a feast it misses! Route 66, you remember, is
        where you get your kicks (was&nbsp;it Nat King Cole who sang that?).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Right
        now I'm basking in&nbsp;flawless Arizona sunshine in a carpark 7,000
        feet up on Grand Canyon's south rim, legs recovering from Tuesday and
        Wednesday's trek to the bottom of the canyon. As I emerged last night,
        no more sweat left to sweat, a group of kids who'd done the same
        20-mile, 4,500ft slog&nbsp; down and up again ahead of me chorused
        congratulations.&nbsp;They looked puzzled&nbsp;when&nbsp;I&nbsp;returned
        the compliment. A whisky and ginger back in the Chevy's&nbsp;rarely gone
        down more easily. Needless to say the astounding beauty of the inner
        canyon overwhelms the pain of the extreme effort needed to get to the
        Colorado River on foot, along steep&nbsp;tracks that&nbsp;you start off
        along in ice crampons, past brilliant sandstone canyon walls and desert
        vegetation&nbsp;and &nbsp;sometimes cling precariously to cliff edges
        from which there's a sheer drop into the muddy river. Were it not for
        the steak that awaited me at Phantom Ranch at 5.0pm on Tuesday -- and
        not a minute later -- I might have flinched at this tight-rope stuff,
        and the bouncing suspension bridge that gets you, pretty tired by this
        stage,&nbsp;100ft high&nbsp;across the Colorado. Then, after a night in
        the bunkhouse, a repeat performance upwards -- seven and a half hours
        up, against&nbsp;my four hours down. Cactus, cottonwood trees, ravens,
        deer, bird, plant&nbsp;and animal-life galore -- the canyon-bottom
        abounds with life invisible from the top. And all against a sky
        faultlessly blue for the past two weeks.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">But
        to go back a bit, and that $10 bet I agreed to place in Las Vegas before
        I left Nevada. I emerged from my day at the Sunset Station casino, an
        enormous gambling spot&nbsp;in the east of this gambling mecca, exactly
        one dollar and 25 cents down. But the unlimited food they provide&nbsp;
        -- American, Mexican, Indian, Chinese (you name it) to keep the punters
        punting all day and all night put me well into profit. Besides you never
        have far to go in America to get from the ridiculous to the sublime.
        Next day I'm on the short hop to the Hoover dam, half of which is on
        Nevada side of the Colorado and half on the Arizona side. One minute
        you're in a bawdy city-of-all-cities, next minute you're looking at an
        astonishing American engineering feat and work of art of gigantic
        proportions. So often I've looked at American buildings (like the marble
        public monuments they're still constructing in Washington DC; or the
        State Capitol in St Pauls, Minnesota) that seem to have vast, gilded
        quantities of the most expensive raw materials thrown into a rather
        formless, plagiarised design pot. But the Hoover dam, built in the
        1930's,&nbsp;is different. There can't be anything more fluently
        representative of Art Deco, beautifully executed. What's more, it's
        functional art; the dam provides vast quantities of electricity from 15
        enormous turbines and also regulates the Colorado River. I'm left
        wondering, along with a native American onlooker standing next to me,&nbsp;how
        a nation of people capable of this can be so fearful of the outside
        world.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">But
        that's just the point, as you see when you travel off the main route,
        through an America that so challenges the routine image of a
        city-society. On my way through the middle of Nevada, across desert
        between 5,000 and 6,000 feet high, I passed through a continuous film
        set of the gold-rush days. Sad, decrepit towns of shanties and
        trailer-homes, all surrounded by rusting junk and ever-present dreams of
        making the big strike. Places like Goldfield; Tonopah, once the site of
        a big silver mine; and&nbsp;Austin, 7484 feet up in the Toyabe mountains
        and overlooking the still-active gold mines of the Big Smoke Valley. You
        drive by a gallows (&quot;We still hang 'em here,&quot; said the man
        lounging in a shop doorway halfway up Austin's main street), casinos
        galore (many offering cheap meals and free overnight parking) and large
        roadside hoardings advertising brothel-ranches (&quot;New Ladies Have
        arrived!&quot;). Nevada's the only state in the US where brothels are
        legal.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">America's
        more than one place. Route 66, a by-way embodying so much of the
        romantic Wild West,&nbsp;reminds you as you drive past.&nbsp;I've
        attached a few pictures that spring from wry, nostalgic&nbsp;American
        humour.</span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,
        Friends:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        been a strange week. One day I'm sitting at my own dining table in a
        spectacularly beautiful new house high above the Arizona town of
        Prescott, relaxing in&nbsp;ultra comfort.&nbsp;A few more days and I'm
        sharing a bench in&nbsp;the dusty, high mesa&nbsp;village of Shungopavi
        with a family of Hopi Indians -- mum, dad, three daughters and several
        grand-kids&nbsp;-- digging into a steaming bowl of noskwivi (lamb and
        corn stew, liberally garnished with lamb fat and roasted chili peppers).
        I'm still running to catch up with a severe cultural challenge.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Among
        the few things&nbsp;Prescott and Shungopavi&nbsp;have in common are
        American nationality, Arizona soil, brilliant sun and unblemished blue
        skies -- and SUV's (sport utility vehicles), the new-generation,
        four-wheel drive cult&nbsp;toys without which the United States would be
        incomplete. I hope I'm not misquoting him, but I'm sure George Bush said&nbsp;SUV's
        are&nbsp;good because they enable Americans to get out in the bush
        spotting terrorists.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Anyway,
        I'm at Prescott, receiving several days of the warmest hospitality&nbsp;chez&nbsp;clients&nbsp;from
        my days as a furnituremaker at Curthwaite in the north of England.
        Believe me, it was uncanny sitting on my own oak chairs at my own oak
        dining-table in the middle of Arizona. (Well, not my chairs and table
        any more --&nbsp;you know what I mean). I've been in North America and
        travelling on Lydia B and the Chevy camper&nbsp;for nearly four years
        now.&nbsp;First it&nbsp;sent my head spinning backwards. Then a certain
        pleasure&nbsp;at the trans-Atlantic&nbsp;journey&nbsp;these bits of wood&nbsp;have
        made, and the&nbsp;link they symbolise&nbsp;between people in two
        distant places.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        -- a week ago now --</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">having
        tracked down two lovely little bits of Navajo Indian silverwork
        containing the palest turquoise from the Dry Creek mine in Arizona's
        north, I left for one of the Navajos' most revered places, Monument
        Valley, right on the border with Utah. On the way, I drive through the
        vast lavafields of Sunset Crater, whose eruptions nearly a thousand
        years ago&nbsp;re-shaped a vast area of north-east Arizona. Then to the
        ruins at Wupatki of ancient Indian pueblos -- stone-built,
        multi-occupant communities -- over the Painted Desert,&nbsp;splashed
        bright red in vast, distant&nbsp;streaks by deeply coloured rock
        outcrops crumbling to deep red sand amid the scattered sage, and on past
        Kayenta&nbsp;to Monument Valley.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        utterly breathtaking. I mean, I've been out in the high desert for
        nearly three weeks now,&nbsp;rarely parking the Chevy below 6,000 feet
        each night in all that time. So I'm getting accustomed to these vast,
        vast spaces of the American southwest. Suddenly, driving the 17-mile
        dirt road through Monument Valley, I'm in the bottom of an enormous
        canyon confronting&nbsp;gigantic, statuesque, natural rock sculptures.&nbsp;It's
        barren, parched, red all around and hard to figure out how the few sage
        bushes and juniper trees survive. The stillness is rivetting. Navajo
        live&nbsp;in it.&nbsp;It's easy to see where&nbsp;their religious
        mysticism comes from.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Then
        I detour back to the Hopi Indian reservation. There are about ten
        thousand Hopi Indians in a small area northeast of Flagstaff, inhabiting
        three high mesas in a tight community over a few miles.&nbsp;They're the
        artists of the First Nation peoples (the name Indians use to remind us
        that North America really belongs to them, not Uncle Sam). Silverwork,
        pottery and katsina dolls -- intricate figures carved from the root of
        the cottonwood tree, painted and dressed to represent spirits inhabiting
        the nearby San Francisco mountains, and around which&nbsp;all Hopi life
        revolves -- account for about three-quarters of the tribe's economy.
        They command extremely high prices to visiting tourists from cultures
        where hand skills have dwindled to a meaningless trickle.&nbsp;I&nbsp;met
        Priscilla Nampeyo, elderly potter daughter of a long-famous Hopi potter,
        in her modest, ramshackle (by the standards of my English&nbsp;culture)&nbsp;little
        house on the steep road&nbsp;up to First Mesa. She was finishing a new
        pot, hand-coiled with painted and clay decoration, fired outside with
        wood and sheep manure. The price? 1,500 US dollars, said without
        flinching. From what I see of the crafts trade here, she'll probably get
        it.&nbsp;Wasn't it the white man who invented supply and demand?</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Soon
        I'm knocking on Weaver Selina's door at the village of Shungopavi,
        Second Mesa. The weaver was his father, now dead. Weaver the son turned
        to silversmithing 37 years ago. There's a neat showroom and workshop in&nbsp;a
        new, pueblo-style house. There's a fairly new John Deere tractor
        outside. Like all the Hopi, Weaver's also a dry farmer, growing corn and
        a few other kitchen crops on unirrigated land -- all of it owned by the
        tribe. In Weaver's display of overlaid silver, intricately cut with Hopi
        mystical symbols, I&nbsp;find a ring with a delicately-cut road-runner
        bird and the lightning symbol, for rain (this area gets between five and
        seven inches a year, mostly about July). The road-runner is the Hopi
        symbol for the message-carrier. Seems appropriate. A sale's agreed. I
        spot a new computer in Weaver's office. Before I know it my&nbsp;camera's
        out and I'm spending the next three days photographing all of Weaver's
        jewellery, editing the 150&nbsp;results on my own lap-top, making a disc&nbsp;and
        transferring them to his computer, about which he knows little. I
        explain how to send e-mails to his customers as far away as Japan,
        attaching pictures; how to use his own new digital camera,&nbsp;and
        write detailed instructions. Weaver and his Hopi wife Alberta invite me
        into their home, feed me for these days, talk at length about Hopi life
        and take me at dawn to January's Buffalo dances in the dusty little
        plaza inside the&nbsp;ancient village.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        mind-blowing. Groups of dancers elaborately dressed in buffalo skins,
        Hopi&nbsp;maidens in woven white mantas decorated with multi-coloured
        geometric designs, white buckskin boots, turkey and pheasant&nbsp;feathers
        in their long, black hair; boys and young men&nbsp;dressed to represent
        deer,&nbsp;with kilt-like skirts and&nbsp;head-dresses of antlers and
        juniper fronds; boys and men with blackened faces, girls a floury white.
        All dancing a choreographed story&nbsp;to the penetrating&nbsp;chanting
        and drumming of a group of Hopi men who accompany them&nbsp;as they
        emerge from&nbsp;their Kiva, the underground ceremonial chambers dotted
        around the village. It's all urging the spirits to send rain and food
        for survival. Flat roofs of the&nbsp;pueblo stone houses round the
        earth-floored plaza&nbsp;are packed with Hopi onlookers. It goes on for
        two days while the sun is up, with more visiting clan groups
        representing different spirits and creatures from nearby Hopi villages.
        It's a time for extended family members and friends to&nbsp;drop in&nbsp;for
        noskwivi.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Sadly,
        I have no photographs of these incredible scenes. The Hopi are a very
        private people and ban all photography and recording, even note-taking,&nbsp;in&nbsp;their
        villages and at religious ceremonies. I'm itching for images, but toe
        the line in return for this privileged look inside their lives. It's a
        dazzling, thought-provoking&nbsp;other world about which I was ignorant.
        It's hard to imagine a culture more coherent and more in touch with its
        environment. I'm very sad to say goodbye to Weaver and Alberta, though
        we promise to keep in touch on his new computer. I want to meet more
        Indian craftsmen and women. Soon, in New Mexico, the Navajo rug-makers,
        the Zuni jewellers and the Santa Clara potters.</span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,
        Friends:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I'm
        standing on the edge of the biggest hole in the ground I've ever seen.
        It's five miles long, two miles wide, about half-a-mile deep and it's in
        America.&nbsp;(Where else?) It's sunny, but the air's&nbsp;opaque with
        fine dust and a sort of dislocated&nbsp;hum of many motors fills the
        whole area, coming from nowhere but everywhere&nbsp;-- I think it's&nbsp;from
        the tiny trucks I can see crawling slowly along dirt&nbsp;roads&nbsp;way
        down in the bottom of this pit.&nbsp;It's too far away to make out
        people. It's uncannily like one of those James Bond movies. You know --
        the empire of evil Bond's sent to tackle twice yearly. I haven't seen
        any armed guards&nbsp;yet (usually jack-booted, cold war&nbsp;East
        Europeans, weren't they?), but notices warning &quot;Private property.
        No trespassing. Violators will be prosecuted&quot; cover the area for
        miles around this little south-east Arizona mountain town.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Copper's
        what it's all about. Morenci is the United States' biggest copper
        producer. The operation's run by the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the
        world's Mr Copper. Here's a few impressive numbers:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Every
        day Phelps Dodge moves over 800,000 tons of material. Those tiny trucks
        have 14-foot diameter tyres and carry 350 tons of ore at&nbsp;a time. So&nbsp;forgive
        my old-fashioned surprise, stopping at Georgina's, nearby Clifton's&nbsp;newest
        roadside coffee shop, when I meet Loy, a willowy-slim feather of a&nbsp;young
        woman, about mid-twenties I'd say, who reveals she drives one of these
        monster Caterpillar trucks for a living, twelve-and-a-half hours in
        round-the-clock shifts, for sixteen&nbsp;US dollars an hour. Her
        boyfriend does the same, only he gets seventeen dollars. He's been with
        Phelps Dodge a bit longer.&nbsp;They both get company medical cover --
        an enormous benefit in the United States, where an average couple
        outside a company scheme pays about 6,000 US dollars a year for health
        cover. With no significant public cover, that's uppermost in so many
        Americans' daily thinking.&nbsp;If there's anywhere to get an insight on
        what makes the United States tick, it's here in the vast, mineral-rich
        desert and mountain spaces of the southwest.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Morenci
        and Phelps Dodge for a start. Size-wise, it's off&nbsp;any&nbsp;scale
        I'm familiar with. The corporation&nbsp;built and owns the current
        Morenci -- shopping plaza, houses, library, schools, swimmimg pool,
        hospital&nbsp;and all -- having buried an earlier Morenci town under a
        waste dump&nbsp;in the hole as the vast operation expanded. They don't
        go underground for it. They tear the mountainside apart to get it. Gold
        and silver mining towns -- most of them ghosts now -- I've already
        described passing through in the Chevy on my round-about way south from
        British Columbia back to Lydia B in Virginia. This is different. At
        Morenci, and at the older, now significantly decomposed&nbsp;town of
        Clifton a bit lower down the valley -- where the copper boom began in
        the 1860's -- you breathe and eat copper. Copper dust covers the whole
        area. Vast, flat&nbsp;leaching-beds of waste containing sulphuric acid,
        hundreds of acres in extent, lie above Morenci. Acid's what they use to
        extract copper from crushed ore (there's no smelting anymore.
        Electrowinning's the new process)&nbsp;-- though&nbsp;the company says
        all the acid's reused and none escapes into the ground-water in the
        reclamation process. Copper pays the wages.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Life
        here is just different. Maybe less wild now, but it's still the west
        that Americans poured out of the east over a century ago to seek&nbsp;fortunes
        in. The characters we in Europe think of as Hollywood creations are
        thoroughly real for Arizonans. Geronimo, the Apache warrior who fought
        the newly-arrived Americans over a century ago, is said to have been
        born at Clifton. (I spent a couple of hours in a lovely little museum at
        Truth or Consequences, just over the border into New Mexico, looking at
        Geronimo's documented history. The museum also contains a stunning
        collection of artefacts from the pueblo Indian cultures. And where else
        but in the United States would you find a town called Truth or
        Consequences? Actually, until 1950 TorC, as it's locally known, was
        called Hot Springs. The town voted to change the name after a national
        radio show staged a performance there).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Then
        there's the&nbsp;OK Corral, scene of the famous shoot-out by Wyatt Earp
        and Doc Holliday against a cowboy gang. It's a real place&nbsp;at
        Tombstone, a few miles&nbsp;northwest&nbsp;towards Tucson; Billy the Kid
        robbed and marauded not too far away; Wild Bill Hickock operated nearby.
        At Taos, up in the mountains of northern New Mexico where I was until a
        week ago, staying with Bill and Emily, a furniture-making couple from
        Washington,&nbsp;there's a Kit Carson museum. Western life, a booming
        southwest American arts scene and Indian culture sit alongside each
        other.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Clifton's
        hey-day was in the copper boom of the early 1900's. Once-elegant
        buildings in&nbsp;Chase Creek, the town's original main street,&nbsp;have
        been mostly empty and decaying for the last 30 years.&nbsp;Only now are
        there the first signs of interest in buying and restoring them. All that
        remains of the Lyric Theatre is an empty, arched facade. Wandering with
        my camera along the street I met&nbsp;Charles Spezia, grandson of one of
        the two Italian Spezia brothers who built much of Chase Creek about
        1913. The Spezia name's high up in stone on several of the street's
        neo-classical porticos. Charles retired from his job as a NASA space
        chemist and returned to live in Clifton.&nbsp;He passed on&nbsp;more
        Clifton nostalgia&nbsp;during&nbsp;a spicy Mexican meat-ball meal at
        Basha's up at Morenci, the Lebanese&nbsp;grocery chain that does for the
        southwest what Tesco does for England.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        spend an afternoon with Walter Mares, old-fashioned news-editor of The
        Copper Era, who digs out for me old copies of his newspaper coverage of
        floods that devastated Clifton when the San Fransisco River burst its
        banks in 1983, and of the big copper strike against Phelps Dodge shortly
        after that, when the company broke the miners' union. And I'm astonished
        to hear -- so rarely in my US journey -- doubts expressed about the
        sacred notion of freedom in the United States, admittedly from an active
        Democrat in the middle of a fairly solid Republican state.&nbsp;This is
        that sort of place. I'd begun to think nearly all Americans
        unquestioningly&nbsp;obeyed that&nbsp;official red hand and the
        injunction &quot;Don't Walk!&quot; at all pedestrian crossings.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Then,
        back at Georgina's (the name's fictitious, but the substance is fact),
        to complete a routine day.&nbsp;Georgina's mid-forties. She moved here
        from California less than a year ago when her boyfriend there went to
        jail. She bought a house (for 17,500 US dollars -- it's different here)
        and is now struggling single-handed in rented premises&nbsp; to start a
        coffee and sandwich restaurant. It's tough, lonely work.&nbsp;Her
        daughter came earlier this month and lasted five days in Clifton.
        Outside is&nbsp;Georgina's five-ton truck, which she used for her
        one-woman haulage business. Before that she&nbsp;ran a business serving
        court summonses in Grass Valley, California; and before that she ran a
        window-cleaning business. I'm staggered &nbsp;by this enterprise. But
        this is the American West. It's unremarkable round here.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">And
        so the story continues. It seems a long way from the Hopi village back
        north at Second Mesa, a long way from British Columbia and a long way
        from Curthwaite, Cumbria, England. Since&nbsp;Second Mesa&nbsp;there's
        been the amazing Anasazi pueblo Indian cliff dwellings in the Canyon de
        Chelly and&nbsp;the Chaco Canyon pueblo buildings on the San Juan
        valley, eerily deserted and still substantially standing a thousand
        years later. And an overnight dash from New Mexico&nbsp;to Phoenix
        airport to get a flight to England after news that my mother broke her
        hip in a fall. Parked on top of Phoenix airport car-park I got news of
        good progress and reverted to track.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        an awfully big, multi-faceted&nbsp;country, impossible to drive through
        without looking. I'm learning, perhaps for the first time, to smell the
        roses a bit.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Love
        and best wishes,</span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        another day in the magic canyon. A week here already and I'm finding it
        strangely difficult to drive out of this bewitching&nbsp;place. Again
        tonight the Chevy's parked near the bottom of this age-old valley. The
        5.0pm whisky and ginger's come and gone yet again&nbsp;and I'm dining in
        the dusk on curried bean burritos. There's no-one for miles.&nbsp;KFM-KCUZ
        (that's 'zee'), the local FM station at Safford, 40 miles away, is
        playing non-stop country music. They go together, the beans, the canyon
        and the easy,&nbsp;clip-clop twang&nbsp;with ballads of southwestern
        daily life. (&quot;Well the lawnmower's broke an' the tax is due...
        Where we'll get the money, honey, ah don' know.&quot; Or the number one
        theme: &quot;Ah'm still hurtin' from the last time you walked on this
        heart of mine&quot;. Life's straight-forward&nbsp;here).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">A
        big, bright&nbsp;moon should be up soon. Forgetting the music and the
        sound of the nearby fast-flowing river, perennially brown as it cuts
        deeper through time and&nbsp;the canyon,&nbsp;I could be in a crater on
        another planet.&nbsp;I've made a quick trip down the five-mile dirt
        track to Clifton, that faded copper town,&nbsp;and the library at
        Morenci&nbsp;today to check my e-mails (Ken and Lou somewhere in Texas
        were just reaching for their five-o-clock ice; Carol &amp; John,
        homebound from Deltaville Virginia&nbsp;to Melbourne Australia&nbsp;have&nbsp;reached
        the Caribbean island of Providencia&nbsp;in their boat 'Nerissa'). I get&nbsp;more
        milk and bread and say hello to Georgina and two local customers at her
        struggling little restaurant.&nbsp;Another train hauled by three Phelps
        Dodge company&nbsp;locomotives arrives up Clifton's main street after
        the steep mountain route&nbsp;to bring supplies or&nbsp;pick up another
        load of copper.&nbsp;I'm starting to get waves of acknowledgement from
        passing&nbsp;local truck drivers.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Snowbirds&nbsp;aren't
        pouring into&nbsp;Clifton. They're the generally retired couples who
        migrate by the thousand from Canada and the United States' north every
        winter, looking for sun and filling the RV (receational vehicle) parks
        of the south and south-west. Clifton has one, less than a year old,
        neatly laid out, each place with water, electricity, outdoor benches,
        fire and grill with freely available firewood awaiting the steaks. But
        only two or three of the 38, fifteen-dollar-a-night&nbsp;spaces have
        been filled all week. I parked the Chevy there&nbsp;on Saturday&nbsp;to
        re-charge the&nbsp;deep-cycle battery, have a hot shower and watch an
        Anthony Hopkins video on the on-board TV, paying my fifteen dollars at
        the local police station. Next day I went back up into the canyon.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Clifton
        -- population about 1,500 (it used to be 5,000) -- is&nbsp;a fascinating
        place of ordinary working folk, tough mining history and declining
        architecture, mostly dating from the copper boom of the early 20th
        century. (Though whereever you go in the Southwest, don't look for posh
        houses. Most are small, unassuming, mostly trailer-homes or similar,
        surrounded by&nbsp; old and new cars and domestic junk. Houses are
        rather more places to live than status symbols). You're as likely to
        overhear a conversation in Mexican Spanish as one in English. Stetsons,
        tight jeans and high-heeled cowboy boots are&nbsp; fairly common garb. I
        get a friendly greeting from Raul Sanchez each time I use&nbsp;his
        main-street laundry; but I've never seen anyone else there. Business
        isn't brisk. The RV park, built with federal emergency money after the
        disastrous 1983 Clifton flood, is&nbsp;an expression of hope; but
        there's little&nbsp;to pamper&nbsp;mainstream holidaymakers, save for
        spectacular scenery.&nbsp;Clifton's overshadowed by the enormous&nbsp;Phelps
        Dodge copper mine a couple of miles up the hill at Morenci, the area's
        only significant employer. Southwesterners have long lived with the
        mining industry's potential to create ghost towns. Phelps Dodge is right
        now cutting back. The price of copper, they complain,&nbsp;has fallen
        from a dollar and forty cents a pound to seventy-five cents.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Among
        the first things you notice, driving in, are competing roadside signs
        for three of Clifton's churches. 'The Copper Era', Clifton's weekly
        newspaper,&nbsp;out on Wednesdays, details services at&nbsp;14 churches&nbsp;in
        the two little&nbsp;townships of Clifton/Morenci, ranging from the
        Sacred Heart Catholic Church (survivor of Chase Creek), to the Shepherd
        of the Hills United Presbyterian American Baptist and The Potter's House
        Christian Fellowship. Religion's as fundamental as the environment. I
        wonder how well Europeans understand that.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The
        'Era' sheds more light on daily life.&nbsp;The big story lately has been
        a row between&nbsp;Clifton Mayor DD McCullar and&nbsp;police chief
        Richard Stockton, suspended last November after&nbsp;initiating a series
        of drug-related arrests. There are popular demands for the mayor to
        resign, but he won't.&nbsp;Views are expressed&nbsp;with little apparent
        concern for libel laws.&nbsp;This is free-speech territory. No polite
        duelling etiquette with rules and sidesmen.You shoot from the hip here.&nbsp;In
        Britain we take more time --&nbsp;and hope the problem goes away.&nbsp;It
        occurs to me that George Bush comes from another old gun-slinging state.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Schools
        at nearby Duncan face a budget cut of 120,000 US dollars, the 'Era'
        reports. News editor&nbsp;Walter Mares reports an interview with schools
        superintendent John Payne. There's this disarming bit: &quot;Payne
        looked tired in a pre-meeting interview. He said he had not been
        sleeping well lately as he wrestles with the school's dismal financial
        outlook.&quot; Not much stiff-upper-lip here, I think to my&nbsp;British
        self..&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        go along with Walter&nbsp;in his reporter's coat to&nbsp;a public
        meeting about a new community project. It's about support to convert a
        donated building in Clifton into a youth and community health centre to
        be run by SEABHS ('seabus', somebody said) -- the South Eastern Arizona
        Behavioural Health Services Inc. Clifton really is at the fag-end of
        public wealth and health. I'm impressed by the turnout and the community
        enthusiasm, and puzzled that an area that digs so much wealth out of&nbsp;its
        ground manages to&nbsp;benefit so little from it. Part of the reason,
        I'm told, is that Phelps Dodge only manages to get by on cheap Mexican
        labour.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">A&nbsp;wide
        dirt road leads into the San Francisco river valley, built in days of
        hope&nbsp;for a visitor boom&nbsp;thirty years ago, never finished and
        abruptly abandoned. Local people call it the &quot;million dollar
        road&quot;. It ends in a wilderness. Quite where it was going no-one
        seems to know, except Phelps Dodge was keen on it. I'm first driven
        there in a ricketty 1969&nbsp;truck by Raul Lopez, a&nbsp;friendly,
        70-year-old Spanish-speaker born at&nbsp;Clifton. He&nbsp;spent his&nbsp;childhood
        in the canyon. He retired, returned&nbsp;and runs an ice-plant now. We
        stop every few hundred yards as he nostalgically points out favourite
        swimming, hunting and playing places in the canyon bottom, and the
        now-defunct gold-mine. You don't go far round here without seeing one of
        those, either gold or silver.&nbsp;I&nbsp;go back next day....... and
        the next and the next, biking, walking, driving.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        impossible to ignore the power of the calm in the canyon, and the huge
        sense of time. It's taken millions of years to form. The area's part of
        the Gila (say 'heela -- it's Spanish)&nbsp;geological system. You amble
        by the river picking up stones with traces of&nbsp;turquoise, fire
        agates, fossils and a whole variety of interesting bits of rock. You're
        surrounded by multi-directional rock formations telling the story of
        some enormous past geological upheaval. You scan them -- looking for
        gold. That's the thing about this place -- there's always the sense that&nbsp;riches
        are there, somewhere. All you have to do is&nbsp;be lucky.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">And
        if you're not lucky, you can&nbsp;breakfast by the river, deep in the
        canyon. The only sounds are the flowing stream, chirping little
        dipper-type birds scooting from bank to bank, the crunch of my toast and
        marmalade and the&nbsp;slow&nbsp;ticking of&nbsp;Lydia B's&nbsp;Radio
        Shack clock. It's the same tick I've heard all the way down the Pacific,
        through the Panama canal, up through the Caribbean and into the North
        Atlantic. How many ticks, I wonder, since this Arizona canyon began?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        stick&nbsp;a powerful&nbsp;bear-spray in my trouser-pocket. I haven't
        seen any yet, but I'm told&nbsp;there are bears, mountain lions and&nbsp;wild
        pigs round here, besides a whole variety of deer and antelope. I find a
        few spent cartridges, but no blood.&nbsp;I watch where I put my feet,
        even though rattlesnakes are mostly still hibernating. I'd quite like to
        see one -- though preferably hear it first.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I've
        been on a wild goose chase, too. For days I've been studying what I felt
        sure was a fossil tree at the site of those road excavations. The&nbsp;imagination
        ran wild. I saw wood features in the grey rock&nbsp;that reminded me of
        the trees I worked with in England. Funny, but it wasn't in any of the
        guide books, and no-one here&nbsp;knew anything about it.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        went to the geology department of Phelps Dodge up at Morenci, with a
        digital photo on a floppy disc. I was looking, they said when they
        opened it in their computer,&nbsp;at a dyke of rhyolite, once-molten
        rock forced up through a hole in the surrounding rock by volcanic action&nbsp;twenty-two
        and a half million years ago.</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Ah,
        well! I had a free geology lesson. It was&nbsp;fun while it lasted.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Love

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,
        Friends:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I'd
        intended this to be datelined Curthwaite, Cumbria, England. As you see,
        time was the victor and I'm now back in the United States. Tomorrow --
        insh'Allah -- maybe tonight&nbsp; -- I should be back on Lydia B a few
        more miles up the road in Virginia. It will be a haven, as I'll explain.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">About
        this time&nbsp;on Monday&nbsp;night (sevenish, just after dark) I was
        standing&nbsp;in the middle of&nbsp;a frantic evening rush-hour motorway
        in Atlantia, Georgia&nbsp;chatting to a young black man and wondering if
        my grip wasn't slipping a little. Rush-hour traffic on interstate 85 was
        parting round us, screaming by on both sides&nbsp;and the black cop&nbsp;sitting
        in the patrol car behind, blue light still flashing, seemed to be taking
        an awfully long time talking to base. The emergency service van had
        gone. The young black man was personable -- a business management
        student -- and&nbsp;remarkably pleasant, in view of the fact that I'd
        just run&nbsp;my three-ton&nbsp;Chevy into the back of his smart, black
        Toyota SUV.&nbsp; Nobody&nbsp;was hurt. The&nbsp;young man's car was&nbsp;quite
        unmarked&nbsp;(I can still see it approaching in slow motion and hear
        the crump. 'Oh, shit!' was what I said. I'd been moving to an outside
        lane, struggling with flight tiredness and continental disorientation,
        looking in the mirror while traffic ahead came to a stop) and the only
        remaining mark, leaving aside my pride, was a dent in the Chevy's front
        bumper&nbsp;made by&nbsp;the young man's&nbsp;tow-bar.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It
        was a strange sort of out-of-body experience. Here I am,&nbsp;newly off
        a transatlantic flight after yet more goodbyes to friends, family and
        familiar places, struggling into a new -- or is it&nbsp;old? -- scene,
        brain lagging and clearly still on the left-hand side of the road,
        wondering mainly how on earth I was going to summon enough&nbsp;remaining
        brain to get out of this lethal spot. And&nbsp;looking at myself&nbsp;talking
        to him, and imagining him telling his friends there was this old English
        geezer, as I'm telling you about this nice young black man.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Well,
        I needn't have wondered. The cop finally booked me, stuck a yellow
        ticket in my hand,&nbsp;returned my strange English driving licence (it
        looks more like a credit card, but the point is, it's English -- and
        that's&nbsp;authoritative stuff here), said were were free to go and
        shepherded both of us safely back into the hurtling traffic stream. We
        disappeared into the six-lane&nbsp;traffic lunacy and&nbsp;I&nbsp;sought
        the safety of a rest area&nbsp;for the remainder of the night a few
        miles down the interstate, much&nbsp;too tired to sleep.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I'm
        feeling like a theatrical scene-shifter changing for yet another
        production, detached and on automatic. By tomorrow I'll have driven
        right round the United States since November, from sea to desert to
        mountains, cities to deserted deserts (not all are empty)&nbsp;-- the
        equivalent of half-way round the world (and I've only nibbled at the
        edges); then up and down Britain from friend's funeral to family and
        friends, to sixty-years ago places and back again. I had a haircut at
        Lewthwaite's, the barber's in Denton Holme, Carlisle&nbsp;I went to in
        short pants, perched on a plank on an armchair. It hasn't changed a bit
        in all the&nbsp;time since, save Alan the barber's just retired and
        handed over to Margaret (Margaret, a Denton Holme&nbsp;barber?!). The
        old notice is still on the wall -- &quot;Boys ninepence, men one and
        thruppence'.&nbsp;Somewhere under the latest coat of thick, bubbly green
        paint is the coat that was there in 1945.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">One
        minute I'm at Tesco's in Lancashire, England&nbsp;putting the hire car
        through the&nbsp;power-wash to scrape off Solway mud&nbsp;(&quot; 'ave
        yer dun it before, luv? D'yer know 'ow it werks?&quot;). I've spent two
        months on both sides of French and English Canada and now I'm trying to
        clear enough head-space to sail Lydia B, my seaside&nbsp;home for the
        last four years,&nbsp;across the Atlantic; five hours one way, a month
        the other.&nbsp;Next minute I'm off the plane&nbsp;in the US getting
        milk for a desperately wanted cup of tea at a corner store in a mainly
        black&nbsp;Atlanta suburb, thinking they all look a bit tough and the
        place scruffy and uncared-for, then&nbsp;noticing&nbsp;the shop
        assistants&nbsp;are behind an armoured glass window.&nbsp;I assume these
        days there's some genie protecting me.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">A
        month in a monastery sounds a neat idea (assuming it doesn't turn out to
        be a month in an Atlanta jail).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        what's it all about? I really meant this piece, the last of the
        Lydialogs on this&nbsp;current&nbsp;North American trip, to dwell on the
        why?&nbsp;I get snatches of that question from time to time -- usually
        the nearer England the&nbsp;more oblique it is.&nbsp;From some,
        including my family, I get the feeling&nbsp;I'm nuts or something
        slightly sillier, to have given up a nice house and a hard-won business
        in leafy England to go&nbsp;wandering about in&nbsp;strange, sometimes
        uncomfortable&nbsp;places in a boat and a Chevy.&nbsp;(Which is odd,
        when you come to think of it, in a nation with litle to lean on but
        centuries of&nbsp;hugely successful piracy around the world).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Not
        quite so&nbsp;with friends in Canada and the USA -- and that's the thing
        that&nbsp;really fascinates me. I did it not because it's there (that's
        the unilluminating,&nbsp;dead-end answer we English give to why Edmund
        Hillary and Sherpa Tensing and the like struggle up impossible Everests)&nbsp;but
        because I really want to know, from the roots up. It seems a nice time
        (sixteen hours to go to George Dubyuh's deadline to Saddam Hussein to
        quit Iraq or face war) to think about why things really happen.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        there I am, in left-hand aisle seat 49C of Delta 065 Manchester to
        Atlanta, middle of economy class Boeing 777, introducing myself to my
        four fellow passengers in the row. They're all charismatic Christians
        from the Brownsville Revival School of Ministry in Pensacola, Florida&nbsp;--
        on my right Joanne, a pretty, red-haired 24-year-old with specs and not
        a few spots (like mine), next Kate, the only English girl of the four
        (who I gather gravitated to Charisma via drugs), middle-aged Sandy who
        seems to be the leader and twenty-odd-year-old Ryan, with black
        travel-stubble.. Sooner than you know it we're all holding hands at
        40,000 feet in mid-Atlantic while Joanne says prayers before we all pile
        into Delta lunch (chicken and awful, gooey rice. Obviously the wrong
        prayer).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The
        conversation's entirely about God -- theirs, but so far not mine, I tell
        them. Which serves only to provoke a serious onslaught to persuade this
        ageing sinner to let God in. Only those who do will be saved.&nbsp;But
        I'm only there to listen and provoke. What about, I ask, all the world's
        Bhuddists, Confucianists -- and not least pertinently -- all those
        muslims from Iraq to Indonesia and beyond? Any chance for them, too?
        Total blank here. If you don't believe, you're lost.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        pretty much the same message I've picked up many times on this US
        journey, listening to the proliferation of FM Christian radio stations
        and particularly driving through the south from Arizona across Texas,
        Arkansas, Mississippi, Georgia and now the Carolinas.&nbsp;Churches
        abound and Americans go in numbers that must make Dr Williams, the
        newly-installed&nbsp;boss of the Church&nbsp;of England, green with
        envy.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It
        would be unfair to suggest there isn't a wide diversity of religious
        beliefs and tolerances in the United States, but for the life of me I
        can't see enough difference between&nbsp;Islamic fervour&nbsp;and the
        fervour (I shy at the word 'extremism') I've just experienced in row 49.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">However,
        the plane lands&nbsp;safely&nbsp;through ground-level cloud at Atlanta,
        we get off, hold hands for more prayers at the baggage reclaim and say
        goodbye, me armed with Sandy's newly published book &quot;A Revelation
        of the Lamb for America&quot; and wishing&nbsp;my companions&nbsp;well.&nbsp;Perhaps
        Osama bin Laden's written a parallel&nbsp;book for the lamb of Iraq.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I'm
        alarmed, and&nbsp;wondering what's changed since Richard the Lionheart
        set out on his Crusade.&nbsp;Still, not for me to wonder. I'm just an
        observer at life's football match. The kick-off's pretty soon now. I'm
        just glad I've got a comfortable ring-side seat. And talking of the
        English, I've been reading a wonderful insight&nbsp; -- same title,
        &quot;The English&quot; -- on&nbsp;us strange, screwed up&nbsp;lot&nbsp;by
        Jeremy Paxman, the British TV journalist. It should be compulsory
        reading for every Brit who thought (like most of America, it sometimes
        seems!) that the world still&nbsp;owes us a living.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Love
        and best wishes,</span></p>
