        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Oct. 25.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Hello, Friends:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">So you thought you’d had the last of those
        mailbox-jamming Lydia B logs? Sorry! I’m on the road again – this
        time quite literally. I’m Chevying my way into the heart of the United
        States.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Today’s lunch was Stamm’s turkey breast with
        stuffing, mashed potato and coleslaw (was it coleslaw? Americans load
        everything with sugar – even the coleslaw), eaten in a Chevy van by a
        parking meter off the main street of Carlisle, wet and dark with autumn
        mist and wintery rain. I have to say, though, a la usual US, this
        gas-guzzling (5.7 litre) van is fitted with fully-carpeted luxury
        including fridge, cooker, TV/video, air-conditioning and the rest. Not
        exactly camping in the raw.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">And no – not Carlisle, Cumberland, England – my
        native north English town where I’ve just been re-visiting family and
        good friends. This was Carlisle, Cumberland, Pennsylvania, USA.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Stamm, a thick-set, crotchety old man apparently
        single-handing his lunch menus in an off-street but cheerfully
        yellow-painted little café, and bent double with some back pain that
        forced on him a tetchy yet warm smile, offered me some thick, whitish
        gravy for my turkey. Not liking thick or white gravy, I opted for butter
        instead and attempted to develop the relationship by asking how
        Carlisle, Pennsylvania got its name. Total blank, I’m afraid. Stamm
        didn’t seem much bothered; so I made do with the turkey, packed in a
        polystyrene to-go box, keeping some left-overs to heat up in the frying
        pan later the same day 150 miles further north.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">I’ll return to Carlisle’s origins in a minute.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">I’m on the way to Quebec, Canada, to visit a
        friend from home, recently Canadianised and married. Then some other
        places. I’ve deserted Lydia B, alone ashore at Deltaville Yacht Yard
        in Virginia (uncomfortably close to Richmond, Washington and those mad
        shootings. Richmond’s where I bought my Chevy. They caught them at an
        interstate (motorway, to us English) rest area. My life for
        the next few weeks will have much to do with rest areas, and it’s just
        a little uncomfortable some nights as I settle down to another dark
        autumn night alone. I have a bear-spray – a high-powered pepper spray
        – an arm’s length from my Chevy bed). Rachel’s now back in
        Wisconsin.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">So, back in Carlisle Penn., I called first on the
        Carlisle History Society, in an imposing, turn-of-last-century building
        off the high street. A local woman I met at a petrol station on the way
        into Carlisle told me the town was modelled on my Carlisle, but it
        isn’t really (except perhaps for the sandstone, castellated town jail,
        which clearly resembles the courts at the top of Botchergate in the old
        place. Americans just can’t make quiet little things; Carlisle
        Penn’s a lovely town (more trees than Carlisle Eng – but then
        Pennsylvania all over has more deciduous trees than England had in the
        17<sup>th</sup> century. Right now they’re gloriously autumnal red and
        yellow. The maples are especially stunning). The population at 18,000 is
        a quarter that of my home town; but the buildings, especially the
        official ones like the old and new courthouses, and the churches, are
        bigger in just about the same reverse proportion.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, I drew a blank at the History Society.
        Nobody knew how Carlisle, Penn., got its name. Maybe, they said, the
        Penn family who started Pennsylvania just liked the name ‘Carlisle’.
        I’d so much wanted to hear that centuries ago a pioneering – or
        maybe fugitive – Carliol got nostalgic for home, as I was a bit this
        grey, damp and unseasonably cold day, tramping solo round the streets of
        a foreign, even though it’s an English-speaking, town. I daresay,
        though, in my traveling garb – t-shirt and blue Berghaus fleece,
        pants, socks and sandals, I’m not so recognizably non-native as I was
        in Central America on the Lydia B bit of this epic. Discretion’s a
        pretty valuable asset when you’re digging for impressions in a new
        place.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">So, just having got some cash from a high-street
        sidewalk (pavement) hole-in-the-wall, I accosted the next customer, a
        man of about forty, trilbied and rain-coated, thick-rimmed specs,
        lean-faced and one of those black stubbles that appear two-and-a-half
        minutes after you’ve shaved. He leapt back with his hands in the air
        defensively, and I was instantly mortified at my assault. He’d no
        doubt heard of the arrest of the two Washington<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>snipers but was still in alarm mode. I photographed a sheriff’s
        car, just for the “Cumberland Sheriff” on the side, and the
        sheriff’s officer came running over and I thought he might reach for
        his gun. Sometimes I feel all of America’s in permanent alarm mode.
        “I’m from Carlisle, England, and I just wanted to ask…..” I
        hurried, and the man at the hole-in-the-wall beamed a big, American
        smile. He was a local free-church pastor, he’d been to Carlisle, Eng.,
        that’s wonderful! and I really should visit the Baptist church in
        Carlisle, Penn., the one with the big spire just over there.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">So I go to St John’s Episcopal Church, Carlisle,
        Penn., and am taken inside the large, 19<sup>th</sup>-century building,
        with beautiful, cobalt-blue stained-glass, Norman-arched windows lining
        the nave to see a piece of sandstone set in the wall. The brass plaque
        beneath it says it’s from the tower of Carlisle, Eng., cathedral. A
        stone from my own town! I touch it. All the way from home!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In the church office two ladies tell me St John’s and Carlisle,
        Eng., cathedral are sister churches and the stone came eight or so years
        ago. Talk to the resident St John’s priest, they say; he knows a lot
        about the church.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">But I have to push on north. It’s three-o’clock
        in the afternoon when I drive the Chevy out of Carlisle and onto
        Interstate 81 North, heading for New York state in fading light and
        end-of-the-day temperature. It’s still raining.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sunday, Oct 27, Vermont.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">This is one of those US eastern states they all
        talk about. It’s late now, but the autumn tree-colours are stunningly
        beautiful. Thinking I have time to spare despite the fading late
        afternoon light, I stop at Bennington, the first town I come to in
        Vermont, my furniture-maker’s eye caught by a side-of-the-road craft
        complex in some stunning old barns. I think it used to be a maple syrup
        farm. These states – Pennsylvania, Vermont, New Hampshire
        and Maine --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>are where all
        the furniture-making trees are, and I’m intent on spotting them as I
        drive along. At last there are big oaks; and, of course, eastern maples
        all over the place. And many others I’m unfamiliar with. But their
        leaves, about to fall, are resplendent with colour, even to my dubious
        colour vision.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Bennington’s crafts are a disappointment, mostly
        knick-knacks and no sign of the first-class furniture-making I know is
        here. Then up into the mountains over Vermont’s bottom leg, and all of
        a sudden the landscape is white with snow and I’m in ski-ing country.
        Snowmobiles are parked outside every house. Sooner or later, after
        I’ve driven across North America to friends in British Columbia and
        head south down the Rockies and the Pacific, I’ll be back in warmth
        and sunshine. What an immense place north America is!</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Love &amp; best wishes,</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Ian.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Malta, Montana, November 8.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Hello, Friends:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">So you don’t believe in good fairies? Read on!</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">We’re parked for the night, the Chevy van and I,
        on a piece of gravelly waste ground behind a petrol station in the town
        of Malta, Montana, U.S. It’s dark, damp, only a few of those
        ubiquitous American trucks are on the street and the forecast says
        there’ll be snow tomorrow. The Big Sky, as this prairie state of vast
        rolling grasslands is known, has been sunlit and dry further east today,
        but more cold weather’s on the way in. California and Colorado way
        south have had very heavy snowfalls after a Pacific storm. I’m
        hurrying to get over the Rockies before the next snow comes, though
        I’m doubtful if I’ll make it.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Already in the last two weeks since I left Lydia B
        in Virginia I’ve travelled over 3,000 miles through this
        larger-than-life country, through the leafy New England states of
        Pennsylvania, New York and Vermont to Quebec, then to a wintry Montreal
        to see friends from home and on down the beautiful Rouge River valley to
        Ottawa, where the Ottawa River divides Canada’s capital city into
        French- and English-speaking halves as neatly as if it was the English
        Channel.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Then into the US mid-west heartlands of Michigan
        and Wisconsin and the southern shores of Lake Superior. They’ve just
        had one of their coldest late October/early Novembers in recent times,
        and fresh-water lakes, ponds and sloughs, important haunts of many
        migrating waterfowl, are beginning to freeze over. The wind’s dry and
        penetrating.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">I choose Highway Two, the old main road in the
        north now replaced by an Interstate route further south, to cross
        Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana. It’s been fascinating, from the
        black, wheat and corn-growing soil further east to the cattle ranges on
        the western grasslands. Big vistas, big tractors, big sky. Space is what
        this place is all about. Surprisingly though, the farmsteads are small
        – modest wooden houses and a few sheds protected from the bitter
        winter winds coming down from the arctic by stands of scrubby trees.
        Winter’s a game of survival here. If you’re in this environment, you
        just can’t avoid it.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">So here I am; darkness has fallen, it’s a black,
        drizzling night and I’m driving on, dodging the glare of oncoming
        headlights on the narrow road, having wasted half the day in Grand
        Forks, just inside the Montana border from North Dakota. I was at Radio
        Shack in Columbia Mall, trying to resurrect my dead cell-phone. I’ve
        given up. They couldn’t do anything for me. At least I’ll make some
        miles and get within striking distance of Vancouver. By ten o’clock
        I’m tired. To keep myself awake I’ve been singing “Three wheels on
        my wagon….” You know – “Three wheels on my wagon – And I’m
        still rolling along – The Cherokeeee are after meee……etc……and
        I’m singing this happy song”.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Actually, it was Sioux country I’ve just passed
        through.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, the lights of Malta appear and I’m
        rolling slowly up the main street, past an assortment of diners, motels
        and casinos, peering for somewhere to park for the night. I hear a
        clunk, clunk, clunk from underneath the van. Oh, no --puncture? I get
        out and take a look. No flat tyre. I start off again, and there’s more
        clunking. I stop in a side road and look again, and still nothing. But
        the clunking won’t go away. It sounds like wheel noise. Or is it a
        broken bearing? I find an off-street spot by the tourist information
        office, behind a friendly petrol station, and call it a day. I’m cold
        and tired. Just one last look underneath the Chevy with the torch –
        and there it is. The right rear wheel is hanging on, eccentrically, with
        one nut. Four out of five wheel studs have sheared and gone. I do a
        double-take and check the other three wheels. No doubt – they’ve all
        got five studs and the right rear has only one. I’ve just been
        hurtling in the dark across endless miles of open prairie and the
        Chevy’s collapsed, believe it or not, fifty yards from the door of the
        Malta Tyre Company. As Johnny, Malta Tyre’s technician-manager, said
        next morning: “I think you lucked out!” I phone Bruce in Victoria BC
        and pour myself a whisky-and-ginger.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Next day at eight sharp we get Joe’s wrecker
        (that’s the Americans’ less than confidence-inspiring name for a
        breakdown truck) and haul the Chevy into the repair bay. I’m on my way
        again in a couple of hours, all wheels checked, still shaken by a
        hair’s-breadth escape from serious accident and an uncanny good
        landing. Johnny and friends map out my route. Despite roads that are now
        snow-covered and icy, I’ll head north for Canada to cross the Rockies
        and down into British Columbia. On the way through the north-west corner
        of Montana, over the Canadian border at Sweet Water and into southern
        Alberta I’ll pass some of the most breathtaking winter scenery of
        prairies and mountains I’ve ever seen, and sight huge skeins of
        migrating snow geese heading south at 500 feet out of the setting
        prairie sun, their brilliant white plumage picked out by black wing-tips
        as they pass, with a clamour of anxious chattering, directly overhead.
        The sky’s filled with them. I’ve never seen snow geese before.
        They’re awesome. I just couldn’t stop in time to get a photograph.
        If my wheel hadn’t nearly fallen off, I’d have missed them.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Three wheels on my wagon? Still say there are no
        good fairies?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Love &amp; best wishes,</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Ian.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">PS: I’m now back in British Columbia after
        crossing the Rockies from Alberta in frost, fog and snow. Warm air’s
        now coming in from the Pacific and the great globs of ice accumulated
        under the Chevy in Montana and Alberta have melted and dropped off.
        It’s an utterly spectacular ride from the prairies up through the
        wintry mountains and down to the sea. When I get to Vancouver Island
        I’ll have completed a circle round America since sailing from
        Brentwood Bay in Lydia B in September last year.</p>

        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,
        Friends.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        think I've been watching too many spy films. It's hard, the way things
        happen, not to feel I'm in the plot. Is it Key West all over again?</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I'm
        still in British Columbia, at friend Bruce's, thinking about continuing
        this&nbsp;land journey southwards as soon as Christmas is over.&nbsp;Right
        now the afternoon light's fading to grey and&nbsp;I'm sitting in&nbsp;Bruce's
        kitchen&nbsp;overlooking Saanich Inlet and&nbsp;Anglers' Anchorage, the
        home-from-home dock north of Victoria where I first brought Lydia B
        three-and-a-half years ago, then spent the happiest of times with many
        Canadian friends before sailing south in September 2001. It's been quite
        a thing&nbsp;meeting them all again. The place hasn't changed much,
        thank goodness. But strange, walking down the dock with no Lydia B to
        step onto. I'm missing her. The Chevy van I drove across America is
        parked outside. They're good, vans&nbsp;-- but&nbsp;they don't have
        personalities like boats do. Crewing on Bruce's Sea Bear for the Sidney
        parade of lights a couple of weeks ago stirred the need to take Lydia to
        sea again. I'll be back in Virginia in the spring, say good-bye to the
        United States&nbsp;and set out across the Atlantic for Maryport, my home
        port, in May. Imagine it -- sailing up the Irish sea with a beam wind, a
        clean shirt and Natalie McMaster's Nova Scotia fiddle turned up loud!
        And what after all this? Now, there's the question. Why does it take so
        long to discover that the world really is&nbsp;an oyster?</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">But
        back to yesterday. My head's moving on from BC. I need a space to
        disappear to and do some serious writing. This is the 26th edition of
        Lydia B's log; I need to pull together the events of the last two years.&nbsp;Maybe
        in the mountains of New Mexico, among the Navajo&nbsp;Indians I studied
        as a student social-anthropologist at the London School of Economics.
        Not exactly yesterday!&nbsp;Remembering how things are between me and
        the United States Immigration Service since my summary ejection at Key
        West in June (they warned me, as they filed my finger-printed record
        into the bad-boys computer system, that henceforth I'd have a hard time
        whenever I entered the United States. And so it's turned out, with a
        grilling at Washington Dulles airport&nbsp;and a&nbsp;'random' search at
        Sault Sainte Marie on Lake Superior) I thought I'd better think ahead to
        next March, when my US visa expires. You see, I can't&nbsp;start out
        across the Atlantic&nbsp;until May, so I'll need a visa extension.
        Better enquired about early&nbsp;in Victoria, the BC capital, I thought.
        I just need to know the form.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        I search the Victoria phone book for US Immigration numbers in Canada.
        There's one on Wharf Street. I know just where Wharf street is, down by
        Victoria harbour -- the most beautiful harbour&nbsp;I've ever seen. See
        how maudlin I'm getting about Canada?&nbsp;I phone them -- and get an
        answerphone. Same thing again. And again. Seems&nbsp;it's only a number
        to leave messages on. Nobody wants to talk.&nbsp;Don't the Americans
        want floods of visitors spending money, for heaven's sake?There's a
        Vancouver number -- long distance from Vancouver Island -- that says
        there's no charge for calling. No charge for calling? I call the&nbsp;Vancouver
        number and&nbsp;hear a recorded message. I can indeed talk to a United
        States Immigration officer -- for&nbsp;a dollar fifty US (a pound
        sterling) a minute. Perhaps they're raising funds to bomb&nbsp;Iraq?</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I'm
        thinking now. There are&nbsp;US immigration officers down at the Coho&nbsp;ferry.
        That's the rolly old&nbsp;ferry that&nbsp;crosses Juan de Fuca Strait
        twice daily between Victoria</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">and Port Angeles. I know because I took it a couple of weeks
        ago to stay with friends at Gig Harbour for Thanksgiving. Twenty-one of
        us sat down to a turkey dinner. I thought as I emerged from dense fog
        into sunshine on the drive back past the Olympic mountains what a lovely
        place northern Washington state is.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Anyway,
        I drive the Chevy down to the harbour, put four quarters in the parking
        meter outside the ferry office, run up the steps and find a male clerk
        picking his fingers behind the window. The place is deserted -- next
        ferry's three hours away.&nbsp;The clerk's big, crew-cut, middle-aged,&nbsp;bored,
        unshaven and dressed as though he's just done a sweaty day digging the
        vegetable allotment. A compatriot's&nbsp;slouched over the day's paper
        at a table. I'm not too hopeful. But I explain my visa situation and say
        I'm having trouble talking to a real live US Immigration service
        officer. Friend looks wanly up&nbsp;from his newspaper; both nod
        knowingly that they're not surprised. I'm getting the picture. It
        tallies with what I'm seeing and hearing more and more as Americans --
        the ones whose job it is, that is -- wind up their border security fever
        in the light of Iraq and terrorism. I'm keeping the word 'paranoia' in
        reserve.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Crew-cut
        clerk, though, turns out to be helpful, in a nonchalant, slow&nbsp;sort
        of way. He makes a phone call. &quot;See the Visitor Information Office
        in the corner of the harbour?&quot; he says, elbow on his desk, pointing
        across the passenger hall, out through a window and over the water. I
        see it, puzzled. But it's a Canadian office. What’s that got to do
        with US immigration? No matter. &quot;There's an immigration officer in
        there. Go up the stairs. She's waiting for you.&quot; And what's the
        office called?&quot; I ask. &quot;How do I know it?&quot; &quot;Don't
        ask. There's no name on the door, but it's the only one,&quot; says the
        big guy with the crew cut. I don't think I'm supposed to ask for any
        more details.The picture's filling out. Finding a US Immigration officer
        to talk to is&nbsp;like finding hen's back teeth. They've gone to
        ground. Maybe it's because, unlike US-based immigration officers, the
        ones in Canada aren't allowed to wear their guns. I remember when I
        sailed on the Coho two women US Immigration Service officers wore&nbsp;something
        hinting at a smile instead.&nbsp;They were chaparoned by armed Canadian
        police. Are they afraid of getting attacked abroad? Now <u>there's</u> a
        cultural observation!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        I walk round the harbour to the information office. I still don't
        believe it. Inside I ask the (Canadian) girl behind a stack of visitor
        information leaflets if she's heard of a US Immigration office here.
        &quot;Come this way,&quot; she says, and lifts the counter flap. I go
        behind and follow her, round a corner and down some stairs, past doors
        with no writing on them. The last one's locked, so I press the bell.
        It's still unidentified. Through the glass I see a tall, wavy-haired,
        middle-aged&nbsp;man in civvies -- no US Immigration&nbsp;Service black
        uniforms with yellow &quot;Inspector&quot; flashes on the shoulder. The
        door buzzes and I'm let in and am immediately confronted by tall man's&nbsp;pallid,
        unsmiling face. Is is fear, or in-your-face? Each time I see these faces
        -- and I've seen plenty on my travels through the United States -- I'm
        unnerved. My guilt complex about Key West and panther lady takes charge.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        sign the book and&nbsp;go through the whole visa explanation again. The
        man says to wait there and takes my passport into a back room. Five
        minutes later he's back. Has he checked&nbsp;me on that computer?&nbsp;There's
        a pause while he searches for the words. &quot;You know when you're
        pulled over for&nbsp;speeding in the United States,&quot; he starts.
        &quot;Sometimes the cops book you, sometimes they give you a
        warning.....&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Good
        grief! They locked the door behind me!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&quot;Well,&quot;
        the man goes on. &quot;What I'm trying to say is, there's a right way
        and a wrong way to deal with this. Some of us in this office would just
        tear your current visa-waiver out of your passport and give you a new
        one for six months. Simple as that. Some would do it the right way, so
        you'd have to apply in the United States. Maybe Phoenix, Arizona.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        think I'm getting the drift. I don't think he wants money. I might be
        free to go soon.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&quot;When
        you leave Canada and come by here, ask for Russell or Fred. If you're
        lucky and one of us is here, you'll be alright.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Tall
        man seems to be&nbsp;reaching out through&nbsp;verbal handcuffs from
        this point on -- though when he hears about my boat voyage he wishes me
        the best of&nbsp;luck. I exit the no-name door, up the steps and back
        into the legitimacy of the Canadian Visitor Information Centre. I think
        I've just had the privilege of meeting a sentient United States official
        struggling&nbsp;to make sense of&nbsp;White House heat on border
        security.&nbsp;At the end I sensed a smile, even if I couldn't see it.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Have
        a Happy Christmas and New Year,<br>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,
        Friends:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Enormous.
        That's the word I've repeated to myself over and over these last two
        days. And still it scarcely does justice to the scene I've been
        travelling through since I left British Columbia in the Chevy last
        Saturday, heading south down the western United States; eventually --
        via New Mexico --&nbsp;back to Lydia B in Virginia.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Right
        now it's a quarter to eight on Tuesday night. Darkness is&nbsp;well in
        charge&nbsp;and the temperature here in the high Nevada desert's
        plunging. Despite the heat of today's unclouded winter sun there'll be
        frost on the ground tomorrow morning. I'm tucked into a flat, sprawling
        rest area just off Interstate 80, my only companion in the acres of
        white lines a large container truck and trailer. These things keep their
        big engines&nbsp;thumping away&nbsp;all night for heat in their sleeper
        cabs. These are long-distance travellers. No matter --&nbsp;it's nice to
        have company. I've had supper and edited today's bag of digital
        pictures, gasping in astonishment as the images remind me of what I've
        just passed through. I'm not yet sure how I'm going to send this e-mail;
        I'll look for a phone line somewhere along tomorrow's route through the
        Nevada mountains.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">To
        start nearer the beginning, though. Remember Fred? Fred the US
        immigration officer, that is. Well, Fred -- as arranged -- nodded me
        safely onto the Coho ferry in Victoria and into Washington State on
        Saturday. My new&nbsp;visa's good till June and I'm here legit. I doubt
        if I'll forget&nbsp;Key West and Panther Woman, but she's faded a bit.&nbsp;A
        quick visit to friends at Gig Harbour to collect a cell-phone Fed-Ex'd
        there by Verizon (that's a whole other story) and I'm off down
        Interstate 5, the traffic-laden freeway down California and the Pacific.
        It's grey and damp. I haven’t really settled in yet.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">My
        Gig Harbour friends have urged me to go to Bend, Oregon. We've spent an
        evening enthusing about future plans and places. So at Portland, Oregon,
        I leave I-5 and head eastwards&nbsp;up the Columbia River gorge,&nbsp;parking
        the Chevy just short of The Dalles.(That's a city, not a&nbsp;soap).In
        the morning light I clamber up&nbsp;The Dalles'&nbsp;steep bluff&nbsp;for
        a bird's eye view of an extraordinary industrial scene plonked in the
        middle of extraordinary mountain, river and valley scenery.&nbsp;Massive
        dams, factories, businesses, roads and Union Pacific railyards&nbsp;sprawling,
        unkempt, clanking&nbsp;and&nbsp;rusty. But it's working. A few yards
        away on the unpolluted (?) river there are busy fisheries. America keeps
        stopping me in my tracks. It's full of contradictions for this Brit,
        used to precious little scenery carefully segregated from the mess of
        industry, and to quieter, deferential ways.&nbsp;(And above all, most
        days as I listen to the news about Bush and Saddam,&nbsp;wondering what
        really drives these people to be so at loggerheads with the Muslim
        world. Or is it the world outside America?).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I'll
        get a report on winter road conditions&nbsp;across the middle of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Oregon
        high&nbsp;desert and start the climb through dense fog and white
        hoar-frost up 4,000 feet towards Bend. In the next few days I'll be
        driving on mid-winter roads reaching well over 7,000 feet, through the
        snow-covered Cascade mountains and their off-shoots and vast high
        prairies of sage, juniper, wheat, alfalfa and black beef cattle. And
        thousands of little shacks, trailer-homes and bleakly isolated,
        ramshackle&nbsp;farmsteads plonked into the middle of all this gigantic
        nowhere.The lesson on America's in full swing.&nbsp;Size is what
        matters. And doing things to survive, no matter where, no matter what
        mess it makes.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">After
        Bend, a smart little town handy for the ski-slopes, I head off further
        south-east into Oregon's interior towards Burns, driving off the long,
        straight road reddened by the setting sun and parking the Chevy in the
        desert at 4,500 feet. By morning it's 34 degrees inside the van and I'm
        soon out of my two sleeping bags to a chorus of desert coyotes,&nbsp;making
        a cup of tea&nbsp;and off. We've got another cloudless day and the&nbsp;new
        sun quickly&nbsp;burns the frost off the road. The scenery just goes on
        getting bigger and more astonishing. In Burns I pass a huge wood-mill.
        At the petrol station I'm told all the timber it gobbles comes from
        Canada. Oregon's own timber is a shadow of what used to be. My friends
        in British Columbia, plundered by US timber&nbsp;giants and now
        struggling against a 27 percent levy imposed by the United States on
        timber from Canada,&nbsp;will love that. At the book-shop run by the
        wife of the newly-arrived chief of Burns police I look for a better map
        of interior Oregon.&nbsp;These backwoods places get&nbsp;under my skin.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">More
        high desert, turning to sand now and again, and then I'm across the
        Oregon border into Nevada, home of Reno, Las Vegas, marriage, divorce
        and gambling, and -- here -- Piute and Shoshone Indians. Sure enough,
        not a hundred yards inside Nevada, the first petrol station I pull into
        has a row of three fruit machines. Outside large&nbsp;bill-boards
        advertise casinos down the road. Billboards are ubiquitous roadside&nbsp;culture
        in Nevada.&nbsp;I spend a dollar at a Napa store&nbsp;on a couple of
        fuses for my camera battery-charger, served by a cheerful blonde&nbsp;white
        girl -- the only non-Indian I saw here; they're all about size 18 and
        up.&nbsp;Then off across more high desert to where I am now, the
        similarly sprawling, haphazard industrial town of Winnemucca, miles from
        (almost) anywhere, though it straddles an east-west interstate highway.
        The day-time sun's really strong now and the dry desert air's markedly
        warmer than back north, though it chills suddenly at dusk.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        a new agenda of&nbsp;impressions. How like their&nbsp;subjugated,
        problem&nbsp;Indians these Americans are, dropping their rusty
        throwaways whereever they fall, and spreading out into more space.
        That's just the point; there's so much of it. Looking at the sprawling
        cabin and trailer homesteads of Paradise Valley, though it's 2003&nbsp;it
        seems a stone's throw from the pioneering rush.Covered wagons have
        turned to SUV’s and big four-wheel drive trucks. If you're a State
        Department official in far-away&nbsp;Washington,&nbsp;Burns and
        Winnemucca must seem almost as far away&nbsp;Baghdad. Doesn't Iraq have
        desert and SUV's&nbsp;too?<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">-----------------</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Morning.
        My one neighbourly overnight truck has swelled to six. That's six
        night-long thumping engines. I wake with a headache, probably from
        carbon monoxide exhausts. I switch to 640 metres KFI, from southern
        California, boasting the thinking man's talk radio. On the menu are a
        condemned murderer's interview tapes, a man in court dressed in a white
        robe and an&nbsp;American flag, protesting about something I didn't
        catch, and the latest poison story from London. Some north Africans have
        been arrested in possession -- &quot;well, north Africans are Arabs, you

        So I'm in the deserts of western America, telling you how vast this
        place is. What are the chances of bumping into somebody you know? You
        aren't going to believe this next bit.<br>
        I'm sitting in the Chevy&nbsp;at Winnemucca rest area, getting ready to
        continue my north-south journey. There's a knock on the van door. It's
        – yes --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>it’s Rachel.
        She's travelling west-east from Portland to Wisconsin, delivering a boat
        for a friend and calling at the same rest area. Neither of us had any
        inkling of each other's journey. We decided that when I get to Las Vegas
        I'll invest five dollars each at a casino. As they say here: “Go
        figure!”</span></p>
