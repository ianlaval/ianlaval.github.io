        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,
        Friends.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        think I've been watching too many spy films. It's hard, the way things
        happen, not to feel I'm in the plot. Is it Key West all over again?</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I'm
        still in British Columbia, at friend Bruce's, thinking about continuing
        this&nbsp;land journey southwards as soon as Christmas is
        over.&nbsp;Right now the afternoon light's fading to grey and&nbsp;I'm
        sitting in&nbsp;Bruce's kitchen&nbsp;overlooking Saanich Inlet
        and&nbsp;Anglers' Anchorage, the home-from-home dock north of Victoria
        where I first brought Lydia B three-and-a-half years ago, then spent the
        happiest of times with many Canadian friends before sailing south in
        September 2001. It's been quite a thing&nbsp;meeting them all again. The
        place hasn't changed much, thank goodness. But strange, walking down the
        dock with no Lydia B to step onto. I'm missing her. The Chevy van I
        drove across America is parked outside. They're good, vans&nbsp;--
        but&nbsp;they don't have personalities like boats do. Crewing on Bruce's
        Sea Bear for the Sidney parade of lights a couple of weeks ago stirred
        the need to take Lydia to sea again. I'll be back in Virginia in the
        spring, say good-bye to the United States&nbsp;and set out across the
        Atlantic for Maryport, my home port, in May. Imagine it -- sailing up
        the Irish sea with a beam wind, a clean shirt and Natalie McMaster's
        Nova Scotia fiddle turned up loud! And what after all this? Now, there's
        the question. Why does it take so long to discover that the world really
        is&nbsp;an oyster?</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">But
        back to yesterday. My head's moving on from BC. I need a space to
        disappear to and do some serious writing. This is the 26th edition of
        Lydia B's log; I need to pull together the events of the last two
        years.&nbsp;Maybe in the mountains of New Mexico, among the
        Navajo&nbsp;Indians I studied as a student social-anthropologist at the
        London School of Economics. Not exactly yesterday!&nbsp;Remembering how
        things are between me and the United States Immigration Service since my
        summary ejection at Key West in June (they warned me, as they filed my
        finger-printed record into the bad-boys computer system, that henceforth
        I'd have a hard time whenever I entered the United States. And so it's
        turned out, with a grilling at Washington Dulles airport&nbsp;and
        a&nbsp;'random' search at Sault Sainte Marie on Lake Superior) I thought
        I'd better think ahead to next March, when my US visa expires. You see,
        I can't&nbsp;start out across the Atlantic&nbsp;until May, so I'll need
        a visa extension. Better enquired about early&nbsp;in Victoria, the BC
        capital, I thought. I just need to know the form.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        I search the Victoria phone book for US Immigration numbers in Canada.
        There's one on Wharf Street. I know just where Wharf street is, down by
        Victoria harbour -- the most beautiful harbour&nbsp;I've ever seen. See
        how maudlin I'm getting about Canada?&nbsp;I phone them -- and get an
        answerphone. Same thing again. And again. Seems&nbsp;it's only a number
        to leave messages on. Nobody wants to talk.&nbsp;Don't the Americans
        want floods of visitors spending money, for heaven's sake?There's a
        Vancouver number -- long distance from Vancouver Island -- that says
        there's no charge for calling. No charge for calling? I call
        the&nbsp;Vancouver number and&nbsp;hear a recorded message. I can indeed
        talk to a United States Immigration officer -- for&nbsp;a dollar fifty
        US (a pound sterling) a minute. Perhaps they're raising funds to
        bomb&nbsp;Iraq?</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I'm
        thinking now. There are&nbsp;US immigration officers down at the
        Coho&nbsp;ferry. That's the rolly old&nbsp;ferry that&nbsp;crosses Juan
        de Fuca Strait twice daily between Victoria</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">and Port Angeles. I know because I took it a couple of weeks
        ago to stay with friends at Gig Harbour for Thanksgiving. Twenty-one of
        us sat down to a turkey dinner. I thought as I emerged from dense fog
        into sunshine on the drive back past the Olympic mountains what a lovely
        place northern Washington state is.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Anyway,
        I drive the Chevy down to the harbour, put four quarters in the parking
        meter outside the ferry office, run up the steps and find a male clerk
        picking his fingers behind the window. The place is deserted -- next
        ferry's three hours away.&nbsp;The clerk's big, crew-cut,
        middle-aged,&nbsp;bored, unshaven and dressed as though he's just done a
        sweaty day digging the vegetable allotment. A compatriot's&nbsp;slouched
        over the day's paper at a table. I'm not too hopeful. But I explain my
        visa situation and say I'm having trouble talking to a real live US
        Immigration service officer. Friend looks wanly up&nbsp;from his
        newspaper; both nod knowingly that they're not surprised. I'm getting
        the picture. It tallies with what I'm seeing and hearing more and more
        as Americans -- the ones whose job it is, that is -- wind up their
        border security fever in the light of Iraq and terrorism. I'm keeping
        the word 'paranoia' in reserve.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Crew-cut
        clerk, though, turns out to be helpful, in a nonchalant, slow&nbsp;sort
        of way. He makes a phone call. &quot;See the Visitor Information Office
        in the corner of the harbour?&quot; he says, elbow on his desk, pointing
        across the passenger hall, out through a window and over the water. I
        see it, puzzled. But it's a Canadian office. What’s that got to do
        with US immigration? No matter. &quot;There's an immigration officer in
        there. Go up the stairs. She's waiting for you.&quot; And what's the
        office called?&quot; I ask. &quot;How do I know it?&quot; &quot;Don't
        ask. There's no name on the door, but it's the only one,&quot; says the
        big guy with the crew cut. I don't think I'm supposed to ask for any
        more details.The picture's filling out. Finding a US Immigration officer
        to talk to is&nbsp;like finding hen's back teeth. They've gone to
        ground. Maybe it's because, unlike US-based immigration officers, the
        ones in Canada aren't allowed to wear their guns. I remember when I
        sailed on the Coho two women US Immigration Service officers
        wore&nbsp;something hinting at a smile instead.&nbsp;They were
        chaparoned by armed Canadian police. Are they afraid of getting attacked
        abroad? Now <u>there's</u> a cultural observation!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        I walk round the harbour to the information office. I still don't
        believe it. Inside I ask the (Canadian) girl behind a stack of visitor
        information leaflets if she's heard of a US Immigration office here.
        &quot;Come this way,&quot; she says, and lifts the counter flap. I go
        behind and follow her, round a corner and down some stairs, past doors
        with no writing on them. The last one's locked, so I press the bell.
        It's still unidentified. Through the glass I see a tall, wavy-haired,
        middle-aged&nbsp;man in civvies -- no US Immigration&nbsp;Service black
        uniforms with yellow &quot;Inspector&quot; flashes on the shoulder. The
        door buzzes and I'm let in and am immediately confronted by tall
        man's&nbsp;pallid, unsmiling face. Is is fear, or in-your-face? Each
        time I see these faces -- and I've seen plenty on my travels through the
        United States -- I'm unnerved. My guilt complex about Key West and
        panther lady takes charge.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        sign the book and&nbsp;go through the whole visa explanation again. The
        man says to wait there and takes my passport into a back room. Five
        minutes later he's back. Has he checked&nbsp;me on that
        computer?&nbsp;There's a pause while he searches for the words.
        &quot;You know when you're pulled over for&nbsp;speeding in the United
        States,&quot; he starts. &quot;Sometimes the cops book you, sometimes
        they give you a warning.....&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Good
        grief! They locked the door behind me!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&quot;Well,&quot;
        the man goes on. &quot;What I'm trying to say is, there's a right way
        and a wrong way to deal with this. Some of us in this office would just
        tear your current visa-waiver out of your passport and give you a new
        one for six months. Simple as that. Some would do it the right way, so
        you'd have to apply in the United States. Maybe Phoenix, Arizona.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        think I'm getting the drift. I don't think he wants money. I might be
        free to go soon.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&quot;When
        you leave Canada and come by here, ask for Russell or Fred. If you're
        lucky and one of us is here, you'll be alright.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Tall
        man seems to be&nbsp;reaching out through&nbsp;verbal handcuffs from
        this point on -- though when he hears about my boat voyage he wishes me
        the best of&nbsp;luck. I exit the no-name door, up the steps and back
        into the legitimacy of the Canadian Visitor Information Centre. I think
        I've just had the privilege of meeting a sentient United States official
        struggling&nbsp;to make sense of&nbsp;White House heat on border
        security.&nbsp;At the end I sensed a smile, even if I couldn't see it.</span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,
        Friends:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        nearly time. At long last Lydia B's almost ready to go back into the
        water. There's a last-minute hitch with the alternator (what else is
        sailing, if not a series of&nbsp; hitches?) which we hope to overcome
        today. Launching's scheduled either tomorrow or Saturday; we need a
        couple of days on the water to check the rigging, make sure all the new
        through-hulls are water-tight, stow the bike, secure everything below,
        decide we've got everything on board that we need to be on board, then
        head out into the Atlantic for England.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        been a long wait. Dave Anderson, who's crewing with me, arrived from
        Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, a week ago, guitar in hand. He's deep
        into a Bob Marley song at present.&nbsp;We think Lydia B's in good shape
        to handle&nbsp;3,200 miles of ocean. But it's a tough place, with plenty
        of opportunity&nbsp;before we reach the Irish Sea and Maryport in a
        month or so for water, humidity and general stress to take their toll.
        We have to be able to fix&nbsp;it ourselves.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Most
        of the stores are on board. That's something like 200 tins of meat, veg,
        baked beans, Szechuan and goodness knows what else sauce, pasta, rice,
        dried potato, Mars bars, powdered milk, Dave's beer, my whisky and
        ginger (five-o'clock still comes round each evening on the ocean);
        forty-eight gallons of diesel fuel for the engine and saloon heater;
        sixty-five gallons of fresh water in the two tanks under Lydia's settees
        and ten in one-gallon bottles scattered in any remaining spare corner.
        Plus an emergency hand-powered watermaker, permanently stowed&nbsp;in
        the ditch bag under the saloon table, and a tarpaulin to catch any
        serious showers of rain we happen across.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">There
        aren't many spare corners. The boat's carrying almost two tons of gear
        and&nbsp;supplies (including things collected on the way through the
        Pacific, Central America and the Caribbean. Not least of which is a
        hundred-weight or so of cocobola timber bought at a small sawmill in
        Panama. The axe has already fallen on some of it, but the rest will
        reach Maryport, England, to be used for furniture-making. Then there was
        the bucketful of fire agates and other rock samples collected from
        Arizona on the winter Chevy trip.&nbsp;There's been a general
        weeding-out of anything adding unacceptable weight.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Patrick
        and crew&nbsp;on Plein Sud, a Swiss boat that's almost ready for the
        Atlantic crossing, will be heading out from the same Deltaville yard
        about the same time as Lydia B, making for Bermuda, the Azores and the
        Mediterranean. Paul,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Danish Canadian&nbsp;on&nbsp;Sealise,
        will be a couple of weeks behind us, heading&nbsp;back to Denmark. Mike
        and Gill, Vancouver Canadians on Khamsin with whom I sailed from Key
        West, Florida, are heading&nbsp;north up the US east coast&nbsp;before
        completing a circumnavigation back to British Columbia.&nbsp;It's a time
        for saying goodbyes -- and au revoirs. Long-distance sailors tend to
        keep in touch.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">If
        things go to plan, we'll be making a non-stop crossing via a slightly
        more northerly route -- between 38 and 40N, minding the ice that this
        year has drifted south to 42 degrees, then skirting the Azores high
        pressure system and turning&nbsp;further north&nbsp;for the Channel,
        with first landfall at the Scillies off Britain's southwest
        corner,&nbsp;if the weather co-operates. The Scillies&nbsp;rocks are the
        graveyard of many yachts in bad weather.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <b>Later today:</b></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The
        alternator's been tested and seems OK. So it's back to the drawing-board
        and a systemmatic examination of the wiring, plus a phone call to James,
        its part-author back in BC. It's&nbsp;a frustrating&nbsp;time for a
        problem like this.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">However
        --&nbsp;there's a gale brewing on the Chesapeake this weekend which
        would have probably&nbsp;have delayed&nbsp;our departure anyway, so
        perhaps nothing will have been lost in the end.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">For
        the rest, it's a saying of goodbyes to Deltaville, this sleepy little
        Virginian&nbsp;country peninsula sticking out into Chesapeake Bay,
        former boat-building&nbsp;settlement in the hey-day of wooden boats.
        Sailing and marinas are still&nbsp;its only business. Nothing happens
        here at any particular speed, as I've discovered trying to sell the
        Chevy, redundant since the trip round the US. I'm leaving it at Fast
        Eddie's, a&nbsp; vehicle sales business on Highway 33 near the little
        town of Saluda. Only&nbsp;Fast Eddie's no longer Fast Eddie. There was a
        problem with his lady partner and she&nbsp;took off with the name and
        established&nbsp;her own vehicle sales business. She got the name, so

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Now,
        at this time of year,&nbsp;Deltaville's&nbsp;fields and trees are lush
        green with&nbsp;spring growth. It's a beautiful place and&nbsp;it's sad
        to be saying goodbye just when&nbsp;I'm getting to know people.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">And
        am I sad to be leaving North America after four years -- four years that
        were intended to be no more than one? I am. It's been a process of
        continuous discovery. There's a great deal to assimilate. I thought in
        England I knew something about America, but I see now -- especially
        after travelling round it in the Chevy during the last winter -- I knew
        very little. It's been fascinating. Sometimes frustrating and puzzling,
        but interesting and surprising, always stimulating.</span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">PS:
        we solved the electrics crisis. The fault lay with a corroded
        fuse-holder in the alternator's field circuit. We're back on track and
        Dave's recovered from the shock of suspecting that his installation of a
        new shore-power charger was the cause of the alternator glitch.</span></p>
