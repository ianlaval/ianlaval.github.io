        <p class="MsoNormal">Hello, Friends:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes you have days that reassure you people
        are decent. I didn’t intend to come to Nicaragua after leaving
        Barillas in El Salvador last Friday, and was heading straight for Costa
        Rica. It’s the mistake you often make, following the beaten track
        because – well, because it’s the beaten track. I can thank the
        Papagayos for getting me to Masachapa.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        A small flotilla of five boats, Lydia B being much the smallest at 30
        feet; Wings and Indara are 44 feet, Wild Blue about the same and Tai Tam
        40 feet, sailed from Barillas together. This is the group that collected
        at Huatulco in Mexico, if you remember from past episodes of this log,
        waiting to cross the Gulf of Tehuantepec. We got across safely, of
        course, and thought from then on we had the worst of the Central
        American winds behind us. Not so.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Lydia and I cut a straight line overnight across
        the Gulf of Fonseca , bordering El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua,
        aiming for a brief stopover in a bay sailors have called No Name, for
        the simplest of reasons. The other four boats hugged the shore, but with
        much longer waterlines they’re normally faster than Lydia, so I
        assumed they were all ahead of us by Saturday. Then the Papagayo wind
        arrived, howling across gaps in the Nicaraguan mountains from
        accelerated trade winds in the southeast Caribbean, and all of a sudden
        a leisurely sail turns into something more hectic. Fully reefed and now
        with only a staysail up front, we spent the next five or six hours
        wetting our starboard deck as the Papagayo screamed off the shore at us
        in regular bursts up to 40 knots. I concentrated non-stop, exposed in
        the cockpit to mid-afternoon tropical sun, adjusting the Monitor
        self-steering. Since Lydia has much in-built weather-helm, each gust
        pulled us left of our track, and each time she had to be put back. The
        ride was comfortable enough, and fast;. Lydia B really is a delightfully
        tough sweetie in heavy weather. But by early evening<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>too much sun<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>in the cockpit and too little sleep the night before had me
        on the edge of hullucination. Bits of my memory of the previous 24 hours
        were going missing. Masachapa is a township sprawled along the beach;
        there’s no dock, but a local boat that had just passed me was anchored
        there, so I called the day quits at 5.0 in the afternoon, dragged the
        sails down, turned sharply left, nosed over shallow water watching the
        depth-sounder all the way, dropped the anchor in the open roadstead<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>by the local boat and poured myself a whisky and ginger. It
        seemed the sensible option.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">No sooner had I done that than four fishermen in a
        panga came alongside and suggested I might be in line for breakers
        there. So I upped anchor again (and it’s a manual, not an electric
        windlass. There’s 170 feet of 5/16 chain weighing a couple of
        hundredweight, and an anchor another 35lbs) and followed them
        half-a-mile along the beach to a safer spot. That’s where I now am.
        The Papagayo is still howling, but since it’s an offshore wind the
        seas are flat and Lydia’s sitting comfortably, held by a waterline
        anchor pendant.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">But where were the other four boats? I could hear
        Indara’s VHF transmissions, but they failed to pick mine up. So where
        were they? Here’s what Tom on Tai Tam told me in an e-mail sent on the
        HF radio next day:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><i>Hi
        Ian,<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><i>We
        really hope that this finds you in reasonable condition. I have tried to
        hail you on 4A at our times but to no avail. We (Wings, Indara, Wild
        Blue and Tai Tam) really got hammered yesterday afternoon with winds to
        40 kts and very terrible seas wherever we went - closer to shore and
        further out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We then
        decided to put into the &quot;No Name&quot; anchorage at 11.30.444 -
        86.10.247. Indara got here just at about 1800 and we pulled in at 1900
        on Saturday. Wings, who did not put his sails up at all arrived at about
        2200 and Wild Blue at midnight. What a ride! The wind was ok - we had a
        3rd reef and the stay sail and the boat handled well with it - but the
        short, choppy 3-4 secs. 6-8 ft seas really did a trick on the boat.
        Water all over the dodger and bimini and then filling the cockpit. Then
        my anchors worked a bit loose despite my serious setup to restrain them
        and I had to go (naked) on to the bow with the boat plowing into the
        seas and me getting fully submerged. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        Anyway, I suspect that you may have set your storm sails and decided to
        let the wind push you along further south. Let us know how you are
        faring.<o:p>

        what we’re doing is sitting tight until these Papagayos slow down a
        bit. Which is how I came to get more Nicaraguan hospitality today. Four
        more panga fishermen came alongside, curious about this rare visitor
        flying the British ensign alongside their own blue-and-white courtesy
        flag. (Masachapa’s not on the beaten track. Everybody’s coming to
        take a closer look). Before long they’ve gone back to pick me an
        enormous bunch of mangoes from trees lining the shore, brought some ice
        for Lydia’s rapidly warming cool-box and two freshly-caught fish – a
        barracuda and a mackerel (though not quite the same as the Mackerel I’m
        used to in England). I give them a few cans of beer and they reach into
        their coolbox and give me a half-finished bottle of coca-cola. Against
        all the security advice, I invite Danilo, the panga-owner and his mate
        on board and show them round. They’re fascinated. Then they shake
        hands, dive from Lydia’s side-deck, swim to their panga and wave
        goodbye. These people are always smiling. They returned later in the
        afternoon, this time bringing ripe melons, more fish and a full bottle
        of coca-cola, plus a friend, Roberto. We sit in Lydia’s cockpit and
        stumble with Roberto’s few words of English, my few words of Spanish
        and much sign language through our histories. Danilo has two children,
        one aged eight and one of a few months; Roberto has two and another on
        the way. They look a little sadly at all Lydia’s electronics, and ask
        how much my boat cost. I ask how much Danilo’s panga cost. Lydia would
        buy a dozen Nicaraguan fishermen a fully-equipped panga each. Nicaragua
        is so poor, says Danilo, GPS imports are not allowed. He eyes one of the
        empty jerry-cans tied on deck. I need it, I say. Overnight I’ll think
        I can spare it. I’ll also thin out my overfull wardrobe. It’s
        unlikely Danilo and Roberto will go travelling in Europe when they
        retire.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">I’m
        spending the day writing this log, watching pelicans plunging from a
        great height to catch fish in the sea and have just eaten the remains of
        last night’s curry – a rarity, because in the 90-degree plus heat
        here I’m not cooking an awful lot. Barracuda for supper tonight, of
        course. I talk with other boats in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica
        at the 7.0pm schedule. Lydia’s sitting stern due south into the
        Pacific, the ocean’s rolling under her keel towards the miles-long
        sandy beach and the hot Papagayo’s still howling. Sometimes it’s
        furious, though I’ve stopped looking at the wind-meter. The wind
        generator’s working overtime -- but it’s keeping the battery-bank
        full. <o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Century Gothic">I'm
        trapped by wind at the bottom of Nicaragua. By 6.30 this morning I'd
        taken the weatherfaxes from the US Coast Guard station at New Orleans,
        Louisiana and was ready to go further south -- I'm only 650 miles from
        Panama now, anxious to get there and turn north again in the
        Atlantic.&nbsp;<br>
        But I won't be going anywhere today -- maybe not tomorrow either. Lydia
        B's swinging at anchor in this out-of-the way bay which sailors call No
        Name. I've no idea what the Nicaraguans call it; it's anonymous on the
        chart. If I sneak in later (I haven't checked into Nicaragua yet) I'll
        ask. It's inhabited by an apparently thriving Nicaraguan fishing
        community whose pangas and open-sided, tin-roofed shacks line the beach.
        There are street lights, traffic and a couple of smarter houses, too.
        The place is beautiful. Folk here don't seem to notice the wind. The
        pangas scoot in from and out to sea tending the nets, wind or no wind --
        though to give me my due, they scoot at 35mph against Lydia B's 5. And
        they have crew. Yesterday I tacked here for eight-and-a-half hours at
        3.7 knots, Papagayo on the nose, bar a couple of degrees, keeping my
        eyes peeled for fishing nets.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Century Gothic">The
        Papagayos are named after the Gulf in Costa Rica just a little way
        south. Like the Tehuantepeckers we tasted a short while north, they
        start in the Caribbean and come hurtling through gaps and over low land
        (hereabouts over Lake Nicaragua), getting magnified by heat ashore. They
        blow routinely at 30 knots (about 34mph); a gust was clocked at 63 knots
        (over 70mph) by a cruising sailor a couple of weeks ago. His inflatable
        dinghy was blown out of the water and burst. Best way I can describe it,
        when a gust hits Lydia B, is this: her wind generator, mounted on an
        eight-foot pole on the stern and normally more or less silent, suddenly
        sounds like a propeller-driven aircraft throttling up at the end of the
        runway for its take-off. The boat, all 7 tons, leans over, stretches the
        sag out of the heavy anchor chain, pirouettes and starts to sail. Then
        the gust passes and the chain sags again, pulling the boat back to where
        it was. So far the anchor has stayed buried in the mud. The GPS -- who
        said technology's no good? -- will buzz me if Lydia B moves more than 30
        yards in any direction.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Century Gothic">So
        this morning I unhanked Lydia's head- and stay-sails, stowed them below
        and hanked on the heavy storm jib (the mainsail was left double-reefed
        from yesterday). I haven't got a lot of use for the regular headsails
        right now. But the wind just got stronger. Now the forecast by one of
        the amateur weather pundits -- who's very often right -- is for 40 knots
        tomorrow (gusts come 40 percent higher). So I went nowhere, and nowhere
        looks a possibility for tomorrow. Frustratingly, I've only got about 100
        miles to go to finally say goodbye to the peckers and the papas. Then I
        expect to be motoring in calm. That's the Pacific!<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Century Gothic">So
        to while away the time (besides enjoying writing to you) I've e-mailed
        NOAA (the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) --
        that's the outfit that does all the weather predictions and sends them
        out by fax to people like me on boats -- to ask them why their forecasts
        for the Papagayo area seem consistently to bear no relation to
        actuality. It's lore among sailors. Today, as with most daily
        under-estimates, they forecast 15 knots. That would get anybody's
        grandma and granddad out on the water for a pleasant day's sail. (I
        thanked them very much, though, for the vital service they provide).<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Playa del Coco, Costa Rica, March ?/02</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Hello, Friends:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">At last! Lydia B escaped the Nicaraguan wind-trap.
        We got out of No Name (which is really called Aspierto by the
        Nicaraguans who live there – don’t ask me why sailors don’t
        recognize it) and sailed overnight<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>for Costa Rica as soon as the winds eased. These days we’re
        quite happy with 25 knots of wind on the nose, and that, for part of the
        45-mile escape passage to Bahia Santa Elena in Costa Rica, was what we
        got. Two more American boats joined the rush – Sailmates and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Ku’uipo, both headed for Panama and the east coast of the U.S.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">A brief stop in Elena, reached early in the morning
        when we discovered the local chart was wildly inaccurate and thought
        better of navigating through the rocks in the darkness, and we were off
        again into quite crazy seas and 35 knots of wind round Cabo Santa Elena
        and into the Gulf of Papagayo. It’s an education in timidity and
        trust. These boats seem as if they’ll take any punishment the weather
        throws at them. All three ran before, then beat into a relentless
        Papagayo, flying the tiniest bit of reefed mainsail we could manage, all
        of us flat in our starboard beams – then all of a sudden it gave up,
        stopped dead and went flat calm. We motored the rest of the way into
        Bahia del Coco, the northernmost Costa Rican port of entry, dropped the
        hook and called it whisky and ginger time.<br>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Hello Friends:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">In case anyone thought I’d<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>abruptly jumped overboard at the end of the last (unsigned –
        sorry!) log piece, I’m still aboard Lydia B. We’re back on the fast
        track to Panama.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I pulled
        into this little Costa Rican fishing town at dawn after overnighting
        across the Gulf of Nicoya. This time the Papagayos are behind me for
        good. They bade us a lusty farewell as we rounded Cape Velas in company
        with Sailmates and Ku’uipo, the two American boats who’ve been
        Lydias’s companions for the last week or so. Then, quite suddenly,
        they gave up. For the first time in three weeks the offshore howling
        stopped and a balmy new<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>wind
        coming off the Pacific picked us up and led us gently to Bahia Potrero,
        then Bahia Carrillo and now to Quepos. It’s so long since I’ve been
        able to make toast and marmalade, and fresh-ground coffee, while Lydia
        sails herself in steady winds. Yesterday I had time as we bowled along
        to make some salad<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and eat<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>more of the tuna I caught the day before with a towed line. It
        was a skipjack; not the gourmet’s favourite and as dark-fleshed as
        beef,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>but it tasted pretty
        good to me.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">In the Gulf of Nicoya – gateway to Puntarenas,
        Costa Rica’s main Pacific shipping port – we stayed awake on the
        radar, dodging incoming and outgoing freighters. Twice in the darkness
        we appeared to be on a collision heading and twice Lydia’s course was
        changed at the last minute to let a tanker and a freighter pass across
        her bow. They probably saw us. We hope so.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">I’ll unpack the inflatable today. I need to scrub
        Lydia’s waterline. It’s bright green with slime and weed accumulated
        in the last month or so as we head into warmer and warmer waters.
        Lydia’s taken so much punishment from the Papagayos that the least I
        can do for her is freshen her up. I’ll polish the brass, too. The
        trawler lamp that hangs over the galley, and the brass post that’s
        such a feature of these boats are green and spattered with salt spray.
        Then – if Costa Rican officialdom is back at work after the Easter
        festivities – I’ll check out of the country to leave tomorrow and go
        further south. There are only eight degrees between us and the Equator.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Love &amp; Best wishes,<br>

        Lydia B.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><br>
        Balboa, Panama,
        April 14, 2002.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Hello Friends:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">So this is why we do it. It’s romance. It’s why
        we endure moonless nights groping through the darkness in our little
        boats thousands of miles from home; getting thrown around by big, driven
        seas and breaking waves we can’t see until they hit us; getting tired,
        wet, hungry and sometimes a little afraid; always hoping to get there
        soon and safe. Sometimes, of course, sailing exhilarated in tropical
        sunshine on blue water under a blue sky, Lydia B leaning to a steady 15
        knot breeze on her favourite quarter, a white bow wave curling out as
        she puts mile after mile under her keel, led by playing dolphins,
        sailing herself while I make another cup of tea. The reason’s here at
        the Panama Canal.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">My little boat and I sailed here last Thursday,
        tied to a mooring at Balboa Yacht Club and are now 4,683 miles away from
        the friends we left in British Columbia, Canada. That’s the United
        States, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica ago.
        Some of them, like family and friends in England, have sometimes asked
        why I’m doing it. The answer – as good as I can think of, anyway –
        is in watching the freighters from every corner of the globe that arrive
        non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day of the year to cross this amazing 50
        miles of engineering that link the Pacific to the Atlantic. It links
        people everywhere in the world by trade. It’s what happens with so
        much of what we buy in supermarkets and drive on roads everywhere,
        before it reaches the neat, clean, clear-wrap stage.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">I’m moored at the Pacific end of the canal – I’ll
        take Lydia B through it in another week – right by the Bridge of the
        Americas, linking central to south America. The freighters pass,
        separated by feet, in both directions up a narrow channel a couple of
        hundred yards from my mooring, rocking Lydia with each passing wake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>‘Bow Heron’, a chemical tanker from Norway; ‘Asian Olive’,
        a banana carrier from Singapore; ‘Sea Tiger’ from Hamburg, stacked
        with containers so high on deck you wonder how the vessel doesn’t fall
        over; ‘Nerano’ from Malaysia with oil; car-carriers, general
        freighters, smart new ships, rusty old ones; fully laden ones, empty
        ones; some clanking, some purring. A few imposing white cruise liners
        too. And, of course, an accompanying stream of Panama Canal Authority
        tugs and pilot boats beetling never-endingly back and forth to meet new
        customers.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Trade, pleasure – its all here at the Panama
        Canal. I wonder if John Masefield passed by here (you know – ‘I must
        go down to the sea……’).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though
        it’s been administered by the United States for much of this century
        and Balboa has nothing if not a stately American colonial feel with its
        grand, cream-coloured buildings and wide, palm-lined avenues (so like
        the colonial elegance of Raffles Singapore and Semiramis Cairo), it’s
        now entirely in Panamanian control. The taxi-driver pointed out General
        Noriega’s ex-headquarters (remember him?) when we passed on the way to
        Flamenco to find old tyres to use as Lydia B’s extra fenders in the
        canal.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The canal is part of Panama’s staple income.
        Transit fees for Lydia B – all 30 feet of her – will amount to about
        US$700. That includes having her officially measured to see if she fits
        the canal – after all, she’s just another ship as far as the canal
        authority’s concerned. She’ll be just another name on the day’s
        transit list.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The big ships pay something like $45,000 dollars
        each time they go through. (I haven’t counted them, but there seems to
        be one every 20 minutes or so, round the clock. Officially there are
        13,000 transits a year. That works out at about a billion dollars
        annually). The alternative for us all, of course, is quite a long way
        round Cape Horn, not without its own discomforts. So maybe it’s a
        bargain at the price. We’ll motor through – sailing isn’t allowed
        – flying the national (British merchant navy red in Lydia’s case)
        ensign in its usual place on the backstay, and the Panamanian courtesy
        flag from the starboard yard-arm, exactly the same as the big ships
        ahead of us. I wonder if they’ll see, painted on Lydia’s starboard
        quarter, her port of registry – ‘Maryport, UK’ –and wonder where
        Maryport is. A century ago, of course, before the advent of the Panama
        canal, they surely would have known, because these Cumbrian places were
        once major Atlantic trading ports.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Isn’t this just the stuff of romance!</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Then I have to have an official canal authority
        adviser aboard, plus four line handlers to keep us in position when the
        lock chambers start boiling with incoming water to lift us over the
        Central American isthmus; and they’ve all got to be fed. We’ve got
        some homework to do before we start out. Luckily I’ll be re-joined by
        Rachel, who sailed with me and Lydia between the Queen Charlotte Isles,
        on the Alaska border in the far north of British Columbia and San Diego,
        southern California, on the border with Mexico..</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">I’ve already forgotten about the Tehuantepeckers
        and the Papagayos, the merciless offshore winds that gave us such a
        buffeting off El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. They’re
        part of the memory, and a distinct building-block in our sailing
        experience, for I feel now there’s little that Lydia B won’t take us
        safely through, if we do as she tells us to do. She understands the
        seas. They’re a bonding process, and I’m a little in awe of this
        boat. She’s been cleaned underwater, we have a few small sail repairs
        to do, the brass is being polished, her water and diesel tanks filled
        again, fresh stores put aboard and an electrical glitch with navigation
        lights to investigate. I suspect there’s a salt-water short-circuit in
        the forward chain locker. So far she’s enjoyed every nautical mile of
        the way. I think she’s looking forward to the Atlantic, going north
        and long summer days after the twelve hours each of light and dark this
        near the equator. We’re at 07 degrees North now, but we’re headed
        steadily north from here since Punta Mala at the bottom west side of the
        Gulf of Panama last Wednesday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s
        a good feeling to be pointed towards my northern roots.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Then we’ll set off for Miraflores, Pedro Miguel
        and Gatun locks, probably holding our breath, hopefully in company with
        friends on other boats we’ve got to know on the long way to Panama.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b>Balboa, Panama, April 20/02.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Hello, Friends:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Lydia B and I are still at the Pacific end of the
        Panama canal, lined up in the queue of boats waiting to do the transit.
        There’s a backlog, and we’ve been given a tentative date of April
        29. We’ve been officially measured and have all our extra fenders and
        handling lines aboard for the three sets of canal locks. Since the
        weather window in the Caribbean is limited – the hurricane season
        officially starts on June 1 – it’s a bit frustrating to be sitting
        here and not sailing north.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Still, that’s life. We’ve been told to keep
        checking with the Panama Canal Authority’s traffic people in case the
        date gets shifted forward. Sailors are optimists.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">So I’m using the time to do some housekeeping .
        I’ve emptied and cleaned Lydia’s 7.0 cu ft coolbox (we don’t have
        a ‘fridge, so we’re dependent on supplies of ice. They’re
        obtainable pretty well everywhere here – combatting heat is a
        universal activity in these latitudes). Poorly ventilated shipboard
        places like fridges tend to be bacteria traps. I’ve also cleaned the
        bilge, receptacle for everything that flows in and drains to the
        boat’s bottom – melted ice from the coolbox, sea-water drip-dripping
        through the stuffing-box, the bit below water level that keeps the
        propellor shaft sealed and lubricated, water splashed around in the
        galley and the head<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>--
        anything that spills. And, of course, rain coming in, which is what
        happened two nights ago during long and heavy rain. Since I was engaged
        in long and heavy sleep – with all the hatches and portlights open ,
        of course – things got wet, including my bunk. The rain’s welcome,
        though. It brings cooler air with it. It will also help to wash away the
        salt of the sea and the terra cotta dust of Central American sugar fires
        that have coated Lydia for weeks now.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">It’s been quite a domestic few days. The new
        mainsail we blew the mast slides off way back at Turtle Bay in Mexico
        now has new slides. I spent part of yesterday with sailmaker’s
        needles, palm and waxed thread cross-legged in the cockpit sewing new
        ones back on. My head is rejoicing. For the last six weeks I’ve had to
        use the old mainsail, kept aboard as a spare. It has a considerably
        longer leech – the back edge of the sail – than the new one, which
        means that the boom is much lower. So low that it’s below my head
        height when I’m standing. Repeated bruises<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>-- booms always hit the same old bruise -- show how painful that
        has been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I never got used
        to it. But I had the new main made with a shorter leech specifically to
        raise the boom clear of my head. It’ll go back up today.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Meanwhile I’ve been looking through the hundreds
        of digital photographs I’ve taken since I left San Diego, California,
        on January 21. Here’s a few of my own favourites. I’m not sure what
        they represent, if anything in particular. Except it’s hard to ignore
        the extraordinary colour and happy, unkempt, make-do bustle of life in
        Central America.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Love &amp; best wishes,<br>
        Ian,<br>
        Lydia B, Balboa.</p>
