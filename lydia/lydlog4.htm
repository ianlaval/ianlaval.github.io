      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Barefoot Landing, South Carolina, July 14/02.</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Hello, Friends:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Mid-July, and Lydia B, her paint-work now definitely
      travel-stained from a year’s non-stop voyaging<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>round North and Central America, is still ploughing her way through
      the marshes and swamps of the Carolinas, aiming for Virginia, the
      Chesapeake and a well-earned wash-and-brush-up.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">So far, we’ve kept ahead of the worst of the
      thunderstorms that are a key feature to life around here. We’re never
      far from black clouds; daily we see great lightning flashes and torrential
      rain descending on somebody somewhere in the far or near distance. At
      Beaufort, a hundred miles or so south, we heard NOAA weather radio urging
      people around Charleston to take cover immediately from severe
      thunderstorms and 70mph winds. But these things are local; we sat tight at
      Beaufort and stayed safe. People here seem nonchalant about the seasonal
      hurricane threat. I haven’t quite got that way yet and will breathe with
      relief when Lydia’s in the north of Virginia and relative safety.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">This is the other America. Way since South Carolina
      began, we’ve been deep in Confederate territory. It’s where the Civil
      War fighting started, and for some the battle’s still in progress. While
      the rest of the United States flies the stars and stripes in its backyard,
      you’re liable to see the Confederate flag still flying around here. The
      language is different, full of c’mons and y’alls. And those grits and
      gravy, a sort of pulpy cereal mash they add to meals here like we add milk
      to tea. I felt compelled to have them with my breakfast eggs and bacon in
      Beaufort, urged to try them. I‘ll stick in future to good ol’ bacon
      and eggs.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">For the time being I’m single-handing again. Rachel’s
      off to Wisconsin. So I’m refining the art of
      hand-steering through the narrow channels of the Intra-Coastal Waterway
      for something like 12 hours a day, at the same time feeding and watering
      myself and generally staying awake. With a bit of planning yesterday on
      the stretch from Georgetown to Barefoot Landing I broke records for
      down-and-up the companionway to re-heat some Rogan Josh curried chicken
      left over from the last night’s anchorage, get it into a bowl and back
      behind the wheel without going aground. Yesterday evening at about 6.0pm,
      having roller-coasted on a 2-knot ebb current for several hours and
      determined to push on another 15 miles, I’d just radioed Barefoot
      Landing swing bridge to open for me when I spotted what few sailors have
      ever seen – a free dock. So I hastily swung about, fixed bow and stern
      lines, called to a fellow sailor ashore to take one and parked for the
      night. The dock’s on the edge of a shopping mall and restaurant complex.
      So I’ll probably stay the rest of the day, catch up on some writing and
      photo-editing and leave tomorrow. Only in America.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Gradually as we go north the scenery’s changing. We
      started off with vast expanses of open marshland in the low country of
      Georgia and South Carolina. Now, on the verge of North Carolina it’s
      closing in. Just after leaving Georgetown yesterday we entered magnificent
      old cypress swamp, with trees right down to and growing in the water with
      huge root systems adapted to cope. It’s a tough environment. The
      waterway shows hurricane scars all along its banks. Whole uprooted trees
      line many areas; boats blown from their moorings are abandoned and
      rotting. Notices along the ICW announcing hurricane drill and constant
      cyclone updates from NOAA weather radio, tailored to individual
      communities, remind you that in spite of the pleasure-beach scene that
      stretches right down the Atlantic coast, this is tough country.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The wild-life, of course, is astonishing. Yesterday I
      passed an alligator in mid-stream, going the opposite way. Pelicans,
      egrets, storks, wading birds of many sorts and ospreys in abundance.
      Skiffs taking people to work, pleasure boats of every sort (all, since
      this is America, travelling at high speed). People fishing, building
      waterside houses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s hard
      to put the camera down. The older towns – Beaufort, St Augustine and
      especially Charleston – are nothing if not elegant, full of
      beautifully-maintained colonial houses and public buildings. It’s so
      different from voyaging on the open ocean. Every minute gives another
      glimpse of this fascinating, many-sided country. Spotting dummy figures
      – little boys fishing and a whole variety of life-like waterside
      effigies perched on walls and in gardens -- I’m even beginning to detect
      a sense of humour. Americans don’t smile as we in Europe do, except when
      they have their photographs taken. They habitually confront you with a
      straight, no-nonsense, say-it-as-it-is look. It was astonishing when we
      drove to Atlanta to be met by an Indian motel manager with a gentle,
      welcoming smile. It’s La Difference, that’s all.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Love &amp; best wishes<br>

      Alligator River, North Carolina, July 22.</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Hello,
      Friends:</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">No,
      I haven’t seen a single one. I’ve scoured the mud of the Intra-Coastal
      Waterway for miles of the Alligator River without a sighting (except one
      swimming past – but I only saw its nose).. Wild goats, eagles,
      butterflies, strange insects galore – but alas,&nbsp;no ‘gators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Curious, since I was told Cape Canaveral, way back in sunny
      Florida, is home to 4,000 alligators. So many, the tour bus
      driver&nbsp;said, they’re regarded as a homespun security fence round
      NASA’s space secrets. I never saw one there, either. The best defence is
      the one you think is there but can’t see.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Lydia
      B’s 1,100-mile trek up the Ditch, as this inland waterway up the East
      Coast of the United States is affectionately known, is nearly over. Two
      more days and I’ll be in Virgina and the Chesapeake, within spitting
      distance of Washington and the White House. And in relative safety from
      this year’s hurricanes. Every day now NOAA (the US national weather
      service) reveals more potential hurricane sources way out in the tropical
      Atlantic. With startling dedication – even for a Brit nurtured on daily
      weather talk – NOAA tracks these infant threats, promising to send
      planes to investigate any that look like developing and coming ashore. So
      far none have. If one does, people in Florida and the Carolinas know to
      take cover. I’ve passed mile upon mile of the ICW’s banks piled with
      smashed trees torn up and washed away by these devastating cyclonic
      events.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">In
      a way, the sheer size, richness and roughness of the place helps to
      explain Americans to a travelling Brit. In the last few weeks since
      arriving in southern Florida from the Caribbean and making my way up the
      east coast I’ve had a glimpse of a seriously big, diverse country. Space
      is everywhere, full of life there to harvest – fish in abundance, timber
      and so on. The extremes of weather are a constant reminder that life’s
      tough. Americans seem to work hard and play very hard. They take
      themselves very seriously. (I’m still working on their sense of humour.
      Maybe somewhere I’ll meet some Americans who laugh at themselves, like
      Paddies, Geordies and Newfies&nbsp;do?). The United States is simply a
      fascinating place.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">But
      I spent the weekend with less threatening matters. This morning I sailed
      from Belhaven, a little community just off the Pungo River, which is off
      Pamlico Sound, an inlet leading from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. (It
      was in the news half-an-hour after I left, when a US military jet crashed
      into the Pamlico’s water). At Belhaven – the ultimate American small
      town if ever there was one -- they had their annual regatta, “Pirates on
      the Pungo”. Duck races to raise funds for Pungo community hospital, a
      craft exhibition, hot dogs, Pungo Pirates T-shirts, bric-a-brac stands,
      the lot. And the sailboat racing, of course.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Everybody
      in America seems to have at least one boat. More to the point, everybody
      in America seems to be on the water the minute the whistle goes to stop
      work. They sail, they fish, they water-ski, they para-glide, they jet-ski
      or they just drive around in power-boats. Very fast, usually – this
      being America. It occurs to me sometimes that national self-images have a
      habit of going too long unchallenged. Like the one, for instance, that
      Britain is a sea-faring nation. It might once have been true; but these
      days it seems Brits couldn’t hold a candle to the American passion for
      scooting about on water.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">The
      big local industry in these parts is shrimping and crabbing. All along the
      ICW and in its off-shoots floats marking crab-pots abound, while the
      shallow, muddy estuaries are scoured<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>by a big shrimping fleet. Anchoring one night in the little harbour
      of Southport I was struck by the resemblance between Southport, North
      Carolina and Southport, Merseyside, northern England. Both have huge
      expanses of shallow estuary, and shrimps. Only here the shrimps are
      plentiful and huge. So did someone bring the name from Southport, England?</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">It
      makes a difference, of course, that the water temperature here’s usually
      over eighty degrees Fahrenheit. The record low air temperature for July, I
      was hearing on the radio today, is 68 degrees. Today’s high’s a modest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>85 or so, until a cooling thunderstorm with torrential rain
      overtook Lydia B as she ran before a 20-knot breeze down the Alligator
      River towards Albermarle Sound. At a stroke the cooler air revived the
      crew while torrential rain washed Lydia’s decks. It's wonderful to see
      clean white scuppers again.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">But
      Lydia now needs more than her decks washed. She hasn’t been out of the
      water since before leaving Vancouver Island for Northern BC in May last
      year, before her Pacific journey. Her bottom needs pressure-washed to
      remove&nbsp; green slime and barnacles, cleaned and given a new coat of
      copper-rich anti-fouling paint. And new zinc anodes to protect her
      different metals against electrolytic corrosion. Plus, of course,
      something more permanent than the bung that went hastily in after a
      through-hull fitting collapsed way back in the Caribbean. Her paint-work’s
      in a sad state, fried by tropical sun. Lydia’s in fine shape otherwise,
      but she deserves some tlc after nine thousand miles of&nbsp;coast-to-coast
      voyaging around North America. I'm in for some hard work. (About time, did
      I hear somebody say? Just try doing it!)</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">In
      two or three nights I should reach the ICW's end at Portsmouth, Virginia,
      home of the US navy.&nbsp;I’ll find one of the friendly little boatyards
      that dot the Chesapeake and haul&nbsp;Lydia out in the next few days.
      She'll be sharp, gleaming again and eager to go.</font></p>

        town, a quick walk away from the White House, the Capitol building, the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>-foot high Washington Monument and a list of monumental marble
        memorials, museums, galleries depicting American life and federal

        If I’d arrived from Mars with only a potted history of the Earth’s
        civilization to guide me, I might have thought, looking at these
        innumerable columned porticos, that I was in ancient Greece.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">It’s
        breath-taking. Of course the cars, the pavements full of suited men with
        polished black shoes (you notice things like this after a year at sea)
        and smart lady civil servants, the tourists, the cops manning
        road-blocks at every sensitive street corner (security in the United
        States nearly a year after September 11 is in high alert mode. It’s

        fresh Atlantic tide brings salt water, here it’s a fresh-water river
        flowing through the capital. With a bit of luck Lydia’s slime and
        barnacles will die and fall off before – finally – I haul her ashore
        at one of the many little Chesapeake yards further south. I’d planned

        in all this Washington history-painting). Marble facing slabs on
        towering buildings and huge marble columns are everywhere (where on
        earth is the factory, and is there any marble left in the world to
        quarry?); they look as though they were put up yesterday, or maybe the
        day before, when Congress issued the order to create American history.

        the various monuments to past presidents. For the life of me, I can’t
        stop thinking of Mayan temples.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">What’s
        more, all this is free. Open-air jazz at l’Enfant Plaza, Venezuelan
        music at the Hirschhorn gallery – it’s there to enjoy for nil
        dollars. It’s too much to take in. Suddenly, after the long haul
        inside the Atlantic coast through Florida, Georgia, South and North
        Carolina and Virginia to Maryland (and remember, Lydia B travelled
        Washington State, Oregon and California – the whole of the Pacific
        side -- too), just when we thought we knew a thing or two about America,
        we see we know nothing. So many of our perceptions of this enormously
        wealthy, able and mightily armed, hotch-potch,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>cosmopolitan
        country (it’s impossible not to see the guns, the muscle and the cops)
        have been naïve. We’re trying desperately to work out if Americans
        are bold and sage, or timid folk with a lot of money. Perhaps when there
        eventually is a true American race (native Indians don’t seem to
        figure over-much in this scramble to write history; though they’re
        half-way through building a museum for the Indians, too) we’ll get to
        know. For now, in Washington, they’re digging hard to build a past,
        quickly. Now, that’s what’s different about America – they don’t
        hang around; they jump right in.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Culturally
        overloaded, the five of us spent yesterday biking (we all have bikes
        aboard) to the flea-market at Georgetown, a lovely – Georgian, of
        course – suburb of Washington,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>to
        the canal to watch the old mule-drawn barge, laden with tourists and run
        by people in Georgian period costume; and picking up some rare bread at
        La Madeleine, a French bakery-restaurant on the high street. If there’s
        one thing Americans just can’t do, it’s bake bread; they make it far
        too sweet. There has to be something Europeans are better at, eh?</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Deltaville, Virginia, Sunday August<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>25/02.</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Hello, Friends:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Well, we made it. To the Chesapeake, that is. To
      calm, protected seas in the long, shallow bay that leads over a hundred
      miles in from the Atlantic to the Potomac and Washington DC, and to the
      big conurbations of Baltimore, Philadelphia and further north. We’re out
      of the hurricane area. We’re not too far from New York, as the crow
      flies. But here is where we’re staying put for the time being while we
      give Lydia B some much-deserved tlc below the waterline and sort out the
      next phase.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">We – myself and Lydia, that is --sailed back down
      the wide Potomac from two great weeks in Washington and were hauled ashore
      at Deltaville on Thursday. It’s the opposite of the big city; just a
      sprawling collection of houses on an isolated, flat, wooded and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>pretty peninsula where the only activity is boats, boats and more
      boats. Every corner of every creek houses a marina or a boatyard. They’re
      small, friendly, efficient and low-cost. It’s what the cruising sailor
      prays for. There are stores for boat bits and food, and a library within
      biking distance.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It’s strange being on a boat ashore after so many
      miles and months at sea (it being my only home, I’m still living aboard,
      hooked up to power and water from a nearby supply in what really is the
      middle of a field). My balancing mechanism (the inner ear?) tells me to
      brace myself for a roll, but it never comes. We’re sitting solid. Even
      last night’s thunderstorm and winds never moved us. It’s quite a
      change.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Lydia’s parked among an assortment of travelling
      boats from around the world. Her immediate neighbours include French,
      Swiss, Norwegian, Canadian, British and American vessels. Most of them
      have been left here over the winter while their crew goes for a spell at
      home. That’s what we’ll be doing, too, though for three weeks only. We
      leave for England – on wings – on Sept 4 and will be back with Lydia
      on Sept 25.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, it’s ten days of hull-scrubbing,
      checking things thoroughly – and fitting new through-hulls, the openings
      that let water and other stuff in and out when you want it, not just when
      they fall out accidentally, as one of Lydia’s did in the Caribbean. An
      emergency wooden bung was still in place when we came out of the water –
      still sound, if a bit makeshift.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It’s a strange moment, seeing the boat that’s
      carried you those thousands of sea-miles down the Pacific, through the
      Panama canal and up through the Caribbean into the Atlantic, sitting on
      the travel-lift, her hull fully visible for the first time since British
      Columbia. How’s the anti-foul paint doing? And the zinc anodes? How’s
      the hole? And was that noise I kept hearing from the propellor really the
      cutlass bearing giving up the ghost? Well, she had a good covering of
      barnacles – red-coloured, so they must have joined us in the Caribbean.
      I must phone the paint manufacturers and get their opinion before I
      re-paint with the same stuff. The bung’s still doing its job – but
      another through-hull’s in an advanced state of corrosion (I’ve already
      cut it out to replace); this sort of decay from the proximity of
      dissimilar metals underwater is accelerated by warm water. The water
      temperature up here’s still in the 80’s. And the mid-day land
      temperature – well, that’s another story. A couple of days ago it
      touched 100F. But the cutlass bearing’s as solid as a rock. The noise
      was from a piece of rope twined round the prop-shaft, so it lashed the
      rudder with each revolution.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Already the voyaging community has rallied round with
      support – eggs, sausages and hash browns (battered, grated potato you
      fry for breakfast) from an American couple emptying their fridge after a
      week’s charter; the loan of an angle grinder from Veronique, a French
      girl single-handing from French Guyana, and extension cable from Mike, her
      Polish boyfriend, met on another boat in the nearby marina.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I’m waiting now for French friends aboard Noed’coco,
      with whom we had that great time in Washington; they’ll be hauling out
      at Deltaville too and flying back to Nice until an Atlantic crossing next
      May. That’s why we do it. You just don’t meet so many like-minded,
      out-going people in real life. The pool here has nothing to with it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Love and best wishes,<br>
      Ian,<br>
      Lydia B.</p>
