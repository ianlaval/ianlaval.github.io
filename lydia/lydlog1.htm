        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,
        friends:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Lydia
        B's now in northern California, wending her way (in not too great a
        hurry, as you may observe) southwards. To the astonishment of our many
        good friends at Anglers Anchorage, Brentwood Bay, Victoria BC, the last
        dock party really was the last (for the time being, anyway) and we left
        Canada on September 17. It was hard to leave after well over two years,
        and it's hard to believe. Friday Harbor in Washington's San Juan Islands
        was our first United States port of call -- in just a little
        apprehension in view of the New York bombings and resultant tightening
        of border controls. It was more fear than reality, though. It's often
        seemed to me, on previous contacts with US customs, that they don't know
        their *rses from their elbows; you get a different story about entry
        requirements from each customs official. Understandable, in a way,
        because they're doing the immigration department's job, and they admit
        they&nbsp;don't really know how. What US officials know, if they&nbsp;aren't
        sure about anything else,&nbsp;is how to be aggressive. But we chose
        Friday Harbor because it's familiar; they're nice people in the customs
        office there and&nbsp;we've never had trouble entering&nbsp;Friday
        Harbor&nbsp;before -- and sure enough it&nbsp;went smoothly. We got&nbsp;
        Lydia B's cruising permit (she's British registered now)&nbsp; to take
        us as far as San Diego. A&nbsp;coy English smile&nbsp;&nbsp;goes a long
        way.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        we set off with big ideas about going quickly to San Francisco after a
        first call at Port Townsend, just because it seemed an interesting place
        to be, with its long association with traditional boats. (Here's the
        main lesson about going long-term cruising -- don't ever tell anyone
        when you're going to leave, because it'll turn out to be much, much
        later. Repeated dock parties at Brentwood&nbsp;for a non-departed Lydia
        B attest to that. And don't&nbsp;tell&nbsp;anyone when you expect to get
        there -- there are so many interesting and necessary diversions en
        route. If you feel chagrin at all&nbsp;your delays, remember it's
        probably a minority who get off the dock!).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Anyway,
        at Port Townsend we bumped into another Baba 30 owner, Susan Moffatt,
        who wanted to do the SanFran leg with us. She packed aboard more stuff
        for an intended week than I brought with me from England for the
        forseeable future. Anyway, after a weather delay of several more days at
        Neah Bay, an Indian-operated, expensively built and strangely&nbsp;deserted&nbsp;marina&nbsp;just
        round the corner before Cape Flattery, we launched into the Pacific
        proper one afternoon and immediately got bounced in rough weather. All
        the advice&nbsp;in Canada&nbsp;about leaving before the end of August
        was probably correct. Late September/October lows are getting deeper and
        more frequent and the Pacific high's shrinking positively south now,
        taking its comfortable northwesterlies with it. The Washington/Oregon
        coast performed as we were warned; the winds were on the heavy side of
        manageable, so we got quite big, though short, breaking seas, a boat
        rolling endlessly and frequently surfing&nbsp;down the swells with a
        following northerly. Much of the time we flew only a staysail, steered
        with amazing, tireless&nbsp;precision by the Monitor wind-vane.&nbsp;Rachel
        and Susan were sick more or less right away; I never was, fortunately
        (though I could have been coaxed with a bacon sandwich, or some such).
        So after three days -- making an average of 117 miles a day -- we went
        inshore and docked at Coos Bay, Oregon, to get some sleep. Susan had had
        enough by then and returned to Port Townsend.&nbsp;The boat's now been
        through its paces and we have&nbsp;a sense that she's tough and
        dependable. &nbsp;Lydia B then left for Crescent City, our first
        Californian port, then on to Eureka -- which must have the best (and
        cheapest at US$7.50 a night) publicly-run dock on the Pacific coast.
        Everything brand, spanking new, free power and showers -- and free bikes
        to explore this fascinating Victorian/Californian town; unclaimed stolen
        bikes, courtesy of the local police department. Sometimes it's just hard
        to leave.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">This
        is genuine, west coast America, the heart of the timber -- redwood --
        industry and it's fascinating to this new boy (particularly in traffic
        on a bike). It's colourful, fast, so-different, zany and (naturally) you
        can get anything you want somewhere in town. (That just about describes
        the United States; everything is&nbsp;here, and everybody has to have
        it). The public buses are painted with flowers and there's a
        baby-changing platform in the men's toilet, of course. In&nbsp;an empty&nbsp;car-park
        on Sunday afternoon, a man in a car, door open, playing a saxophone. I
        notice particularly wealth and poverty side-by-side: up-market shopping
        in downtown Eureka, and dossers sleeping in the street round the corner,
        on a patch of waste ground next to the Victorian theatre. Pampas grass
        growing over the derelict rail-tracks on the business side of town.
        There's so much space in north America that when one bit's full or used
        up, you&nbsp;step out of&nbsp;the mess and move on to another patch.
        Maybe it's an unacknowledged reflection of the way the native&nbsp;Indian
        population&nbsp;tends to do&nbsp;things -- the earth reclaims
        everything, so leave it lying where you toss it.&nbsp;It's the garbage
        god.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">You
        have to keep an open mind when you travel like this. It's particularly
        interesting&nbsp;for a Brit who's lived in Asia and Africa (and rural
        Britain, of course) now observing Americans against their native,
        plentiful&nbsp;backdrop in the aftermath of the New York events,
        confused&nbsp;about why these things should be happening to them.
        Americans really are deeply shocked by the terrorist attacks. They've
        unified across the board&nbsp;round the slogans and the
        collecting-boxes.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We're
        now watching the weather for a few days' potential slackening, whereupon
        we'll leave for San Francisco -- two days' sail away, given half-decent
        winds. We can't go further south than San Diego -- a week's sailing
        distant, barring stops -- until well into November because of hurricanes
        in lower latitudes. We've done a few boat jobs -- the alternator&nbsp;went
        awry at Neah Bay, so we replaced it with the spare, and found a spare
        for the spare in a car-breaker's yard, helped by a friendly Mexican
        hailing from Puerto Vallarta. The diesel saloon heater developed a leak
        (actually, it's been malfunctioning for ages, but a blockage in the
        metering jet made it spill out onto the cabin sole, so we finally had to
        face facts and deal with it. Which meant borrowing tools from Murray, a
        Newfoundlander with Chicago wife Colette on a neighbouring&nbsp;42-ft
        boat called Tarazed; I've since bought similar tools -- that's how the
        inventory increases. We've enjoyed several meals with Murray and Colette
        aboard each other' boats.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        it's burritos for supper tonight.</span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,
        folks:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Lydia
        B is now 1,300 nautical miles out from Canada -- a drop in the ocean, so
        to speak, in relation to the distance she still has to go. All this
        passing life at sea and periodically on land is fascinating to&nbsp;her
        crew, who are in the best stall seats. I'll keep on writing, just to put
        it down somewhere -- but if it's causing the faintest yawn for any of
        the recipients of these letters, please don't hesitate to say and I'll
        trim the address-list accordingly. Although we're necessarily out on our
        own, we enjoy keeping in touch as we sail on to new places.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">--------------------------</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        -- this comes from Santa Barbara,&nbsp;first stop in&nbsp;the heartland
        of&nbsp;southern California. We sped past San Francisco without
        acknowledging the sailor's dream -- passing under the Golden Gate&nbsp;--
        to make up some of the time lost to difficult weather coming down
        Washington and Oregon. We want to be in San Diego, on the border with
        Mexico, early November, so we can take off south towards Panama as soon
        as the tropical storm season ends in the 10-20 latitudes. We've been
        watching the weatherfax pictures on the HF radio/computer, transmitted
        by the US Coast Guard. Weather information is everything on a small&nbsp;voyaging
        boat.&nbsp;Daily we&nbsp;know a little more&nbsp;about&nbsp;reading the
        faxes, alongside VHF weather&nbsp;&nbsp;broadcast continously by the&nbsp;flat
        computer voice of NOAA (the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric
        Administration). We hear we'll shortly have a different mechanical
        voice.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Fort
        Bragg, north of San Francisco, was the last serious harbour bar we
        crossed. These constricted&nbsp; Pacific coast harbour entries, with
        their heavy, rolling (and sometimes breaking) swells across shoaling
        sand bars, are&nbsp;brisk affairs. They take planning and concentration,
        usually when you're exhausted&nbsp; with a couple of&nbsp;demanding
        nights at sea, with little sleep. There are fewer bars from now on as we
        go south.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We
        headed across the&nbsp;San Francisco offshore&nbsp;shipping lanes in a
        typical dusk fog, thankful for the radar's 16-mile eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fog
        is resident on this coast;&nbsp;by now we worry less about sailing&nbsp;blind
        on instruments alone. Though having watched&nbsp;the huge hulk of&nbsp;laden
        ships crossing our path&nbsp;ahead at 20 knots compared with our five we
        took the precaution of&nbsp;calling up&nbsp;San Francisco vessel traffic
        service, and the coast guard to let them know we were around.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;We
        got to Monterey at noon next day and dropped the hook in the bay outside
        town. Again, even worse than at Fort Bragg, the noise and stink of
        numberless sealions fighting over every square inch of seaside
        territory, parking their fat bodies on rocks, dock structures and&nbsp;neglected
        boats. They're a protected species here, and they clearly know it.
        They're hated by the fishermen up and down this coast, whose lives&nbsp;chasing
        tuna, salmon and crab are tough, if lucrative for some. Leave a vacant
        space and there's a sealion on it. Their bellowing goes on all night. In
        addition the ubiquitous Canada geese, so much part of the sound and
        visual scene further north, have by now given way to pelicans.
        Monterey's best-known son is the novelist John Steinbeck, whose 'Cannery
        Row' is, of course,&nbsp;set in Cannery Row.We bought the book and
        walked the walk past the now-demolished sardine canneries. On the whole
        though, Monterey seemed a bit overboard in tourist nick-knacks. What's
        really interesting about these places is what created them, besides what
        keeps them ticking in a current, glitzy world.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Coastal
        north&nbsp;California -- maybe like northern parts anywhere -- seemed
        down-to-earth, much about work and practical life. Now we're past Point
        Conception and going east along the southern California moneybelt. The
        rocky shores of further north have given way to sand. Los Angeles and
        Hollywood are a stone's throw away. This is bum-watch territory. Not
        much sign of struggling industry at the waterside here. First
        impressions of Santa Barbara from Lydia B's deck on the narrow harbour
        approach through sugar-brown, shoaling sand, steered by red and green
        fairway buoys to the acres of masts, is of leisure and comfortable
        living. The town-administered marina is packed with over a thousand
        pleasure-boats;&nbsp;the relatively&nbsp;few fishing vessels look a bit
        token; the&nbsp;many very opulent boats here are just for fun. Lydia B
        represents the modest&nbsp;boaters' end. The hillsides&nbsp;visible from
        the dock&nbsp;are covered by substantial-looking houses (typically
        southern Californian red pan-tiled roofs -- after all, this used to be
        Mexico, with Monterey once its capital).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Money
        and sun are here in abundance. So are the people. The rat-pack is denser
        here than in other parts of the USA; there's a distinct absence of that
        laid-back west-coast air we found further north, and especially in
        British Columbia. For the first time anywhere we were asked to show
        identification for ourselves and the boat, with a warning for good
        measure that if we didn't pay the moorage fee within three days, Lydia B
        would be seized. Santa Barbara marina office is staffed by gun-packing
        cop-patrolmen,&nbsp;keen to explain the guns are reassuring to the
        customers. To an English visitor, they seem oddly shocking, especially
        when you find&nbsp;a loaded gun sitting next to you in the coffee shop.
        In an outdoor shop in&nbsp;Fort Bragg an armed cop was&nbsp;proud to lay
        out all the contents of his&nbsp;sagging waist-armoury&nbsp;and explain
        them to me one by one: a .33 pistol loaded with nine rounds, two more
        clips with nine rounds each, a pair of handcuffs and a large pepper
        spray (same size as the one we carry on Lydia. We have no gun, but we do
        have a catapult (slingshot) ).&nbsp;But a&nbsp;marina staffed by gun-totin'
        cops? Only in America. In fact,&nbsp;maybe only in California.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">(Talking
        with residents we discover more than a little fear of Santa Barbara's
        in-your-face officialdom, and wonder if it goes hand-in-hand with&nbsp;a
        money-does-everything culture. Time to leave).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The
        cost of living here is much higher than we've met elsewhere. Food -- and
        housing -- seem particularly expensive. For the first time -- strangely,
        considering the wonderful&nbsp;growing climate -- we found good fruit
        and veg at a one-day farmers' market in down-town Santa Barbara. Still,
        there's no denying the city is attractive, and clean. Spanish-style
        architecture, more and more the norm as we go south, Spanish language
        and tall palm trees are the hallmarks. And the warm temperature -- still
        in the seventies in November. The electric shuttle bus from the
        waterfront to Santa Barbara's extremely attractive central (downtown)
        area has no windows -- that's how much rain they expect to get here.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We'll
        be on our way tomorow or Tuesday, heading 160 miles south-east for San
        Diego, last stop before Mexico.</span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Century Gothic">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Well
        -- here we are at last! The long wait in San Diego, Californian outpost
        of the safe, known, gringo&nbsp;world, is over. Lydia B has just
        rollicked down Baja Mexico, glimpsing whales and gales, and is now
        tucked into Cabo San Lucas for the night.&nbsp;We got here in the middle
        of the night and anchored in darkness just off the beach of this
        fun-and-fajita holiday&nbsp;town, rather than negotiate a strange
        new&nbsp;harbour entry when we were&nbsp;depleted with
        tiredness.&nbsp;Over the last eight days we've covered over
        800&nbsp;sea-miles. Lydia B's been going like the clappers for Panama
        and the Caribbean. Sadly, though we managed a couple of&nbsp;fascinating
        overnight stops in the last week&nbsp; or so, and have at
        least&nbsp;tasted a&nbsp;flavour of&nbsp; remote,&nbsp;terra cotta Baja,
        we haven't had too much time to really smell the roses (as friends back
        at base -- Brentwood Bay, Victoria, BC, Canada -- are constantly urging
        us). It's a sort of battle between two distinct&nbsp;urges -- the urge
        on the one hand to go old-fashioned voyaging in a small, capable boat,
        putting sea-mile after sea-mile past our keel because the going is
        exciting, and on the other the wish that we could stop and meet more of
        the wonderful people we know we're passing by ashore. It might be we'll
        never pass this way again -- though that's isn't a thought we&nbsp;spend
        too much time on, knowing there are so many fascinating things and
        people further down the road. You just have to look at the chart. With
        the prevailing wind on our backs we have Costa Rica, El Salvador,
        Honduras, Guatemala and the amazing Las Perlas Islands of Panama ahead
        of our bow. Then the Caribbean and Cuba.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Century Gothic">&nbsp;'<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We'
        on this leg of the journey is myself and Chris, a young Aussie travel
        writer from Melbourne whom&nbsp;I met&nbsp;in San Diego. Rachel, who so
        far has sailed 3,000 miles with me from British Columbia to the Queen
        Charlotte Islands bordering Alaska and down to San Diego, is heading
        back to Wisconsin for a couple of months to attend to some personal
        things and I hope she'll be rejoining me in Panama. Chris is a great guy
        and it's been wonderful letting Lydia's reins out. She's rewarded us
        with&nbsp;some great&nbsp;sailing in a whole variety of weather
        conditions. The only damage so far has been&nbsp; to the mainsail when
        we got caught overnight in a chubasco off Cedros Island -- a fierce
        offshore wind generated by heat
        and&nbsp;high&nbsp;barometric&nbsp;pressure over desert on the one hand,
        and low pressure offshore. We were reefed down to the maximum, but it
        still tore the top eight slides from the mainsail luff (the leading edge
        of the sail). Seas were, of course, big&nbsp; and ugly -- these things
        always happen when you're most tired and longing for a break in the
        buffeting -- and we were constrained by having to follow an almost
        impossible course through a twelve-mile wide passage between rocks. That
        might seem a lot, but&nbsp;&nbsp;from the cockpit of a little boat
        in&nbsp;foaming, noisy, wind-torn&nbsp;darkness, it isn't.&nbsp;However,
        we did it, marvelled at our prowess and limped along until daybreak with
        a loose-luffed main, held only by the halyard and the headboard. Then
        after a rollicking, six-to-seven-knot sail for several hours under
        headsails alone, still with the land wind hard on our port beam, we got
        into a huge, reasonably protected bay&nbsp; -- Turtle Bay -- and were
        immediately met in the moonlight by a grey whale broaching&nbsp; 75
        yards or so on our port bow. It came towards us -- we were open mouthed
        in&nbsp;exhausted awe by this time -- crossed our bow just a few yards
        ahead, then came back and broached again right along our port side. We
        think these animals, like dolphins, are intelligent. In fact, we rely on
        it -- there's nothing we could do if a whale decided to charge us; but
        they don't.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Century Gothic">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Next
        day, flying the spare main and having e-mailed San Diego for some
        back-up slides and nylon tape, we put out to sea again, going 60 miles
        out in search of a dying wind. It died, of course. But the sea always
        rewards you. In the glassy calm of the next day we were privy to
        everything that moved for miles around. The best catch was a large
        school of dolphins in a fun-and-feeding frenzy. It's impossible to deny
        that these creatures enjoy life. They couldn't be doing anything else,
        with their playful crossing and re-crossing of Lydia B's bow-wave,
        sometimes leaping clear of the water. Somehow they communicate their
        pleasure to those on board. They leapt, dived and turned over alongside
        for us while we photographed them, then came back for another session
        when Chris discovered his camera had contained no film. And just for
        extra, a turtle lazing on the surface with a passenger bird on its back.
        Then we were heading 70 miles out in a straight line for Cabo San Lucas,
        right on the rocky end of the Baja promontory 190 nautical miles
        southeast. No more drama -- &nbsp;though we escaped running over a
        Mexican trawler's fishing nets by no more than 40 yards. He called us on
        the VHF and suggested a port-to-port pass -- but since he wasn't showing
        any navigation lights, we made a guess -- the wrong one. This is Mexico.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Century Gothic">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So
        today we've had showers, done the laundry and cleaned the toilet and the
        kitchen. Two blokes&nbsp;unattended know how to&nbsp;splash the bacon
        fat around. We've topped up with diesel, will top up with water
        tomorrow, do a small repair to the old mainsail, get some ice, some
        fruit and maybe some beer; had an al fresco &nbsp;meal of lobster, beef,
        chicken, mahi mahi and Corona by Cabo dockside tonight, nearly got
        rooked by a thoroughly entertaining restaurant customer tout&nbsp;(who
        is the British guitarist who wrote a song for his dead son?) and will
        get on our way south towards mainland, tropical Mexico. Manyana.</span></font></p>

        <p><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Century Gothic">Sat 0200</font></span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Century Gothic">: --
        The wind WAS good. At this moment Lydia B's relaxing at a leisurely 4.8
        knots with a flattening sea, moonlight and the remains of an energetic
        wind that poured steadily out of the Sea of Cortez as we crossed the 200
        miles from Cabo to mainland Mexico. The wind meter rarely fell below 30
        knots all Thursday night, raising big, breaking seas that periodically
        washed the boat from stem to stern and tumbled over us into the cockpit.
        We tied ourselves to the lurching boat. But both the wind and the water
        are warm --&nbsp;we're getting closer to the tropic of Cancer. You have
        to marvel at the power of the sea. One second Lydia is slipping off the
        top of a new breaking crest as it passes under her keel, her starboard
        deck under foaming water as she tumbles at 45 degrees; the next second
        she's sliding down into the trough behind the wave crest, and in the
        next her eight laden tons are being hoisted 15 or 20 feet like a
        weightless toy to the top of the next crest. The air's full of noise and
        spray&nbsp;blown from breaking crests. But it's steady on our port beam
        and pushes us 100 miles on our way all night, flying only a little
        staysail to give us&nbsp;control yet some speed too. Tonight, however,
        the only noise -- apart from Chris's snoring in the off-watch sea-berth
        below -- is a quiet ripple of water&nbsp;as the port and starboard
        streams flowing over the hull combine on the stern to form a modest
        wake.&nbsp;Helming is being done by the third crew, the Monitor -- the
        dexterous and dependable servo-pendulum self-steering device that needs
        only water-power to keep the boat precisely on course.&nbsp;It's time to
        sit in the cockpit, watch&nbsp;a sky lit by a haloed, waning moon, then
        the first streaks of dawn off the port bow, and&nbsp;have a cup of tea
        (we brought about 1,000 tea-bags) and toast with apricot jam. It's the
        most amazing thing to be slipping quietly down&nbsp;the
        Pacific&nbsp;ocean with a warm breeze pulling Lydia along.<o:p>

        <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello,Friends:<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">You know what they
        say -- any puerto in a storm! This one, aptly named, is Puerto Angel,
        some 240 miles past Acapulco towards my immediate goal of Panama. It's
        on the threshold of the dreadful Gulf of Tehuantepec; I got a sharp
        reminder of that fact as Lydia B sailed in around mid-day yesterday, two
        days and two nights out of Acapulco.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">But wait! There's
        another chapter in the crew saga. Chris, who joined me in San Diego for
        the leg to the Canal, suddenly left -- I think the term is 'jumped ship'
        -- in Acapulco, apparently succumbing to pressure from a girl-friend
        back in California. Thanks to the smart, hi-tec system I've installed on
        Lydia B, she was able to e-mail him several times a day while we were at
        sea. Cry for me, Mexico!<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So now it's for
        real. I'm single-handing, to Panama at least. There's another 1,000
        nautical miles to go -- starting with the Gulf of Tehuantepec just as
        soon as I'm sure there's enough of a lull in the northerly gales that
        start in the Gulf of Mexico, get compressed through a gap in the Sierra
        Madre and burst southwards over the gulf on the Pacific side. It has a
        terrible reputation. So I'm studying the weather forecasts and preparing
        for the 150-mile dash -- with one foot on the beach, as the advice goes.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Yesterday's entry
        into this idyllic little port (a typical southern Mexico village of a
        few hundred people) was nothing short of hair-raising. All the way down
        from Acapulco conditions at sea were benign, with gentle sailing breezes
        by day, more or less flat seas, and calm conditions overnight. By
        setting up the radar's watchman zone, which triggers an alarm if
        anything enters a designated area, I snatched a few hours' sleep
        underway. For entertainment (astonishment, really) I watched a lightning
        storm over the Sierra Madre ashore, photographed an amazing
        sun-reflection in distant cumulus clouds over the Gulf, saw a large ray
        leap clear of the water and flash its white underside at me, and saw
        turtle after turtle, floating idly on the surface with no more than its
        shell visible, raise its prehistoric head, like a golf ball waiting to
        be tee-d off. All this, and steering by the southern cross, a new-found
        friend.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">But an ominous
        heaving of the ocean 25 miles out from Puerto Angel signalled something
        new. No waves, just a very long, very big swell coming from the east.
        Wind and weather was still benign overhead. It was a sure sign of
        something major a long way off in the Gulf of Tehuantepec. By the time
        Lydia reached the entrance to Puerto Angel the gloves were off and we
        were getting buried in 12 to 15 foot troughs, working hard to keep a
        straight line up the 100-yard entry channel. Even though the boat is
        still rocking -- sometimes quite wildly -- inside the harbour, it's a
        relief to have the hook firmly down. I've never anchored in foam before.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I'll study the
        reports of the weather station set up specially for the Gulf before I
        make my dash to Madera, on the border with Guatemala.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
  </center>
        <p align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Meanwhile I've been
        getting acquainted with some delightful people in Puerto Angel. First
        came an ola! off the side of Lydia yesterday from an official of the
        Port Captain's office -- would I please go in the official panga
        (universal, beachable Mexican fishing boat) to meet the Port Captain and
        do the paperwork? That's an education in itself. This port has no boats
        other than pangas -- few cruising boats come here because of the
        Tehuantepeckers. But it has an air-conditioned government office staffed
        by at least half-a-dozen Mexican officials, in meticulously pressed and
        starched white epauletted uniforms with badges of rank, who process
        Lydia's entry to Puerto Angel as though it were a 20,000 ton freighter.
        I shake hands with Senor Ruiz, the Port Captain, sit down at his desk,
        practice my few bits of Spanish and we have a delightfully charming
        conversation about who I am, where I'm coming from and going to, why I'm
        coming to Puerto Angel etc. &quot;Solo!&quot; he exclaims. He suggests I
        write him a letter -- in English -- there and then saying I came into
        Puerto Angel because of bad weather. Copy after copy is made of several
        documents, passport &amp; ships papers and I'm to take a taxi next
        morning to Potchutla, a large town 12 miles inland, to pay at a Mexican
        bank for Lydia's entry and exit dues totalling 296 pesos -- about US$30.
        I get the strange feeling the Mexicans have been doing this same job the
        same way since the conquistadores, with the addition of type-writers,
        computers and copying machines, without noticing there's no longer any
        job to do. It's so beautiful in Mexico! But on the whole it seems fair
        that a Brit, whose nation ambushed so much gold bullion and jewels from
        the Port Captain's ancestors in the days of the Spanish Main, should
        have to cough up 20 quid for stopping by. If I go to Huatulco, a few
        miles nearer the Gulf, I'll have to do this all over again.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">So I get up early,
        hail a passing fisherman in a panga and hitch a ride ashore. You should
        see these people. 100 yards from the steep sandy beach he stops,
        reverses slowly, goes forward slowly and gets the rhythm of the beaching
        surf. Then he throws the throttle of his 65HP outboard open wide, gets
        to 35 or so mph, tells me to get down on the nets and charges for the
        beach, tilting the motor as we leave the sea behind. We're now 40 yards
        inland, 10 feet higher and the boat's stopped. That's a Mexican panga.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Then it's into a
        taxi for Pochutla -- 7 hot bodies in a four-seater, sticky leg stuck to
        stranger's sticky leg, careering up and down the mountain, stopping only
        for an unexplained military roadblock and umpteen sleeping policemen,
        strategically placed nowhere in particular. But Pochutla, a large
        agricultural town, is everything I've come travelling for; totally,
        exquisitely Mexican and so full of colour and people buying, selling and
        being, so far away from European life it's impossible not to see your
        own culture in the obverse. I forgot my camera. But really, did I need
        it?<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I load a bag with
        pineapple, oranges, bananas, tomatoes and fresh bread and get another
        taxi back, a small, elderly lady sitting on the knee of an elderly man,
        total strangers. I find Arturo at the palapa (palm-roofed beach
        restaurant) where I ate grilled fish last night and he gives me a panga-ride
        back to Lydia. So neat, tidy, expensive and privileged.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hello
        Friends:</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">It's
        just gone five in the morning, it's deliciously cool after punishing
        heat yesterday, Lydia B's motionless in still water on a mooring buoy in
        the mangroves of El Salvador and all is silent, save for the&nbsp;faint
        noise of a generator ashore and the familiar, endless&nbsp;ticking of
        shrimps flicking their tails on the boat's hull and the screeching of
        monkeys in the trees. I think there are howler monkeys around here. We
        -- that is, Lydia and I -- sailed in yesterday after completing the
        Tehuantepec crossing and&nbsp;by-passing Guatemala. We rendezvous-ed off
        the El Salvador coast with the four other boats we set out from Mexico
        with and were led&nbsp;by a local panga&nbsp;past huge, breaking surf
        into the lagoon of Bahia Jiquilisco, then through winding, dense
        mangroves overlooked by smouldering, active volcanoes -- Usulutan and
        San Miguel -- until we came, two hours later, to Barillas. A panga was
        waiting to take my bow-line and tie Lydia to a mid-channel buoy in the
        fast-ebbing current, so I didn't have to execute the choreographed
        panic&nbsp;that single-handers have to go through in these tight
        situations, stopping on the buoy exactly the right distance ahead, then
        falling back with the current while I put the motor into neutral and run
        to the foredeck with a boat-hook. Just as well, because I was fully
        stretched after&nbsp;four days&nbsp;at sea.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I
        think I'm in a film-set. You know --&nbsp;one of those
        Hollywood&nbsp;B-movies about politico-military plots in banana
        republics? (I'm showing my crude, first-world&nbsp;culture -- which, of
        course, is precisely why I'm in Central America in my boat, tasting the
        real thing).</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">El
        Salvador is one of the most beautiful countries I've been in. The
        scenery is quite stunning, from the high mountains of the Sierra Madre
        through lush, green&nbsp;jungle to tropical, palm-lined, white
        surf&nbsp; beaches. It's a northern European's dream of where in this
        world it's nice. But El Salvador is also one of the world's poorest
        countries. We saw ordinary life among the villages on the shores as we
        sailed in. Houses are not mortgageable here; they're mostly sun-shades,
        more than houses, made of sticks and palm-leaves. I was reminded of the
        amazing disparities of this&nbsp;world as Lydia, packed with expensive
        technical and indulgent goodies (and this is a comparatively modest,
        little one -- you should see the others!), passed a family of a man, a
        woman and a little girl&nbsp;in a dug-out canoe. They waved cheerfully
        and I waved back -- but what a distance!&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Here
        at&nbsp; Barillas&nbsp;we visiting sailors are lounging&nbsp;in&nbsp;all
        the comforts of&nbsp;one of the best marinas I've seen in the whole of
        North&nbsp;and Central America. Everything's exquisitely, neatly
        organised, from the watered flower gardens, tended grass,
        air-conditioned computer-room with a dozen smart new computer-stations,
        (I can hook up my own lap-top to send this from one of half-a-dozen
        outdoor computer terminals under palm shades in the gardens, then take a
        dip in the nearby pool); wonderful hot-and-cold showers, open-air&nbsp;palapa
        restaurant. The El Salvadorians are wonderfully,
        smilingly&nbsp;friendly. Remember the entry and exit formailities in
        Mexico? Here they were done with no fuss, much charm and no dollars by
        four uniformed officals who visited and came aboard Lydia shortly
        after&nbsp;we arrived. Since I'm a Brit, my visa cost nothing (Americans
        pay ten dollars). Today, they're taking us to the town of Usulutan, a
        few miles inland, to do some shopping; no charge.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">All
        this is basically nowhere,&nbsp;in the middle of a swamp. So how does it
        work? Who pays for it all? (Not us -- it costs eight dollars a day to
        stay here -- though the only money they want is dollars, not their own
        colones. El Salvador is phasing out their own currency). I've been
        nosing around. The clues (for a B-movie watcher) are the ultra, almost
        miltary-style, polish and organisation, and the acres of expensive
        equipment and (though very discreetly and still charmingly friendly) one
        or two dark-uniformed men with pistols in polished leather hip-belts. El
        Salvador has 14 wealthy families, and this has something to with one of
        them. Barillas marina club started out in the days -- just past -- when
        the families ruled the country. It was&nbsp;a weekend retreat (new
        President&nbsp;&nbsp;Flores&nbsp;drops in nowadays with his entourage
        for a meal at the Barillas restaurant. Hes a close friend of Juan,
        the owner and member of one of the 14 families).&nbsp;Recent social and
        military upheaval has turned&nbsp; El Salvador&nbsp;towards democracy and
        re-distributed land into farming co-operatives; but wealth has a habit
        of re-organising friendships and re-appearing in a different guise. Plus
        ca change!!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">But
        I'm not on a film-set. This is real life in El Salvador. I'm dying to
        see how it compares in Usulutan today. Isn't travel fascinating!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Love
        &amp; best wishes,</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Ian.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><b>Later,
        after Usulutan.</b></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Oh,
        boy! If you have eyes to see and are in the mood, you could be shocked
        by the contrasts in this country. We piled into the air-conditioned
        marina bus at 9..0 this morning, exited the steel marina gates after
        picking up an armed guard and bounced along a dirt road past sugar-cane
        fields fronting the volcanoes&nbsp;for ten miles or so before we reached
        the paved highway into Usulutan. We drove through a scene of subsistence
        agriculture -- sugar-cane and coffee principally -- and of
        mud-and-wattle, iron-roofed shelters that are home to so many of El
        Salvador's people, with only the occasional brick house. This really is
        a poor country. It's so easy to miss it, whereever you go in the world,
        unless you look outside the tourist&nbsp;comfort-zone. US reserve forces
        are here -- of course, they're helping to build schools etc.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Anyway,
        we did our shopping -- everything is very, very cheap here, though there
        seem to be few shortages. I walked with my camera through the
        back-streets to the market area. Everywhere I went, people were
        friendly,&nbsp;welcoming and rarely refusing to let me take a picture.
        Back-street life in everyday El Salvador gives me the same message I got
        in Africa and Asia -- that these are tremendous people with small
        material goods and a lot to teach visitors from the first world.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The
        symbol of El Salvador worn by men is the machete, used to work the
        crops. They wear them routinely, fastened to a waist-belt or hanging
        from a shoulder, always sheathed in a hand-made, decorative leather
        scabbard fringed with leather thongs. I wanted one for a momento of
        these people and went in search of a hardware store. The machete was
        there alright, and I bought it (for three US dollars and seventy-seven
        cents) but not the scabbard. So I stopped a man in the street, admired
        his machete and he offered to sell it to me for ten dollars. I'm now a
        sailor with&nbsp;two machetes.</span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b>Bahia Jiquilisco, El Salvador, Thursday March 14/02.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Hello, Friends:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Were a strange lot, us boaters.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We quit jobs and businesses, sell our houses, leave our
        families and friends behind, trade security for the uncertainties and
        discomforts of the sea in little boats. Were surely nuts.<br>
        <br>
        But not to a dozen or so families in El Salvador. Just over a year ago,
        in January 2001, their homes were destroyed in a major earthquake,
        measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale. It was the fifth largest quake to
        strike a populated area  and it happened in a country still on its
        knees from a guerilla war (remember the Contras?), its already poor
        economy struggling. Theyre used to disaster here. However beautiful
        El Salvador is  and it really is  its people live in volatile
        geology, surrounded by active volcanoes.<br>
        <br>
        So whats this got to do with boats and sailors, and how does into get
        into Lydias log?<br>
        Well, as you gather, Im still at Barillas in Bahia Jiquilisco<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>( though Im doing the formalities for departure for Panama,
        and maybe Costa Rica en route, tomorrow morning. I have one more day in
        this lovely country).<br>
        <br>
        But to get back to the earthquake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I spent Monday 3,500 feet up in the mountains, working on a
        relief housing project at a little coffee plantation village called
        Chiripa, an hour-and-a-halfs drive inland<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>up steep, narrow and rutted roads  ox-tracks, really<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>(ox-carts are still common transport round here. Either that or
        Shankss pony. All the way up you see people carrying water  on
        their heads, in wheelbarrows, in ox-carts. Theres plenty of water in
        El Salvador, but often you have to go long ways to get it; few houses
        have taps. Lifes different here).<br>
        <br>
        The point is that when the earthquake happened, on January<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>13 last year, a group of cruising sailors had just arrived here
        at Barillas. To cut a long story short, they went up into the mountains
        to see if they could help, since it wasnt receiving any aid from the
        major relief agencies. The news spread on the boaters radio nets,
        more arrived with relief goods, cash and labour and the sailors went
        right ahead and built six houses at the village of Hacienda Lourdes,
        neighbouring Chiripa, each for two families.<br>
        <br>
        The project, still entirely run by more sailors and still entirely
        independent of any other relief effort  though it has now been
        organized as an official charity, the Barillas Relief Project --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>is still going on. Dennis, a sailor<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>from San Diego, California, arrived -- in a boat appropriately
        named Knee Deep  on the tail-end of the first batch of houses and
        started another five more or less single-handedly.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Hes staying at least until the five houses are finished and has now
        been joined by Neil and his wife, Esther, Canadians from Prince George
        and Vancouver, wholl stay to the end of this phase on their boat,
        Paraquina (NB Ron &amp; Colleen  a Saturna 33).<br>
        <br>
        When I was there on Monday, having bounced and clattered up the mountain
        in an old Volvo (we put a hole in the petrol tank and stuffed it with
        soap, when we got back, to stop the leak), we were putting the finishing
        touches to the first of these, helped by local men, women and children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Though its rewarding for us visitors to El Salvador, the work
        isnt easy in the heat (90-100 degrees) and the dust.<br>
        <br>
        The houses are simple, steel-frame structures clad with weatherproof
        cement board, entirely non-traditional but built to withstand ground
        tremors. They cost a little over US$2,000 each , with three rooms,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>earth floor,<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>electricity and no plumbing  but theyre a luxurious
        advance on the stick, rusting tin and cloth shacks these families have
        been living in since the disaster.<br>
        <br>
        Every penny thats been collected goes into the houses. The sailors
        have dug into their own pockets (helped by $10,000 from the Canadian
        government, which bought a diesel generator to power site saws, welder
        etc), provided all the labour and there are no administration costs.<br>
        <br>
        Now, although funds have been collected for four of the five new houses,
        they need more cash. More land is available if money can be found.
        Its an amazing, unsung story about people.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:-1.25in" align="left">So, relatively,
        were pretty well off in our boats. Ill be sad leaving El Salvador.</p>
