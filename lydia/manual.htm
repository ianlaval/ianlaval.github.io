<p><font FACE="Century Gothic" SIZE="2">NB: Lydia B has been marked CE category D solely to meet the
minimum legal requirements for entry to the European Union following her passage
from the Pacific Northwest to the UK. Please refer to the vessel's Pacific and
Atlantic voyaging history, and the extensive history of sister boats, for evidence of its safe ocean-going capability.&nbsp;

<p><font FACE="Century Gothic" SIZE="2">The current owner objected to paying the
several thousand pounds sterling required for a higher category under the RCD
while boats already within the EU pre-1998 are arbitrarily exempt. Under the
European Recreational Craft Directive (RCD) the placing of a vessel in any
particular category in no way restricts the
vessel to any inshore or offshore area.&nbsp;

<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">NB: Port and starboard
water tanks are connected by a valve in the bilge. When the valve is in the
&quot;both&quot; position, both water tanks may be filled from either of the two
deck fillers. Depending on requirements the tanks may be used separately or
together. It is recommended that on long passages where water conservation is
important, one tank should be in use and the other closed. The choice of tank
may depend on which tack the boat is on. If very long tacks are envisaged (as in
Trade Wind passages), the tank in use should be the lee tank in order to reduce
the boat's angle of heel. </font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Century Gothic" size="3">Risk of flooding.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Maximum recommended
load:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">1,700kg. Weight should be
as evenly distributed as possible. Where practicable, heavier items of stores
and extra equipment should be nearer the centre, midships and bottom of the
boat. While the heaviest items are water and fuel and these are evenly
distributed on or around the centre-line, it should be borne in mind that the
batteries are on the starboard side towards the after end.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Hull openings:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Those operating the boat
should be familiar with the position of all seacocks. All seacocks should be
inspected at regular intervals. Handles should be operated regularly in order to
maintain them in working condition. It is recommended that they should be
dismantled, cleaned and greased annually when the boat is out of the water. It
is recommended that wooden bungs of the appropriate size be kept ready for use
if needed.<br>
The toilet is fitted with a sea-water valve. Except for flushing, this valve
should remain closed.<br>
It is recommended that all valves should be closed if the boat is to be left
unattended for long periods of time.<br>
Cockpit drains in the forward corners of the cockpit well must be kept clear of
debris at all times. The cockpit floor beneath the teak grilles should be
maintained clean to prevent drain blockages.<br>
The stuffing box, accessed through the floor of the cockpit locker, should be
regularly inspected and tightened and/or repacked when necessary.<br>
Portlights and hatches should be kept closed when the boat is at sea in all but
the quietest of weather. It is recommended that the companionway washboards be
stowed in a position where they are immediately available to drop into position
when necessary. It is not necessary to remove the companionway doors.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Bilge pumps:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">The 12v diaphragm bilge
(mounted forward in the cockpit locker) is wired to a float switch at the after
end of the bilge and to an on-off-automatic switch adjacent to the panel by the
navigation desk. This switch should be kept in the &quot;automatic&quot;
position, especially when the boat is left unattended. In the &quot;on&quot;
position the pump may operated manually.<br>
The Henderson MkV manual bilge pump is mounted in the starboard side of the
cockpit well with a water-tight mount for the handle. It is recommended that the
handle should be kept readily available to use in the small locker on the
starboard side of the cockpit coaming.<br>
A 14,000 litres-per-hour centrifugal bilge pump is mounted in the bilge. This
pump may be hard-wired to the batteries for emergency use.<br>
NB: Though a strainer is fitted in the bilge line, it is important to keep the
bilge clear of debris at all times so that bilge pipes are not blocked.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Flooding prevention:</b></font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Risk of Fire:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">The operator should consult
the manufacturer's handbook for safe operation of the engine.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">The engine should be
visually checked before starting. Oil and cooling water levels should be
checked. Belts should be checked for tightness. Fuel and water pipes should be
checked for leaks. The engine seat-water strainer should be checked for
blockage. On starting, the flow of cooling sea-water should be confirmed at the
stern exhaust outlet. The battery digital monitor should be checked to ensure
that the engine alternator is functioning satisfactorily. While the engine is
running it is recommended that items should not be stored on top of the
engine-hatch cover in order not to accumulate heat. An engine over-heating
buzzer is provided in the cockpit array.<br>
Combustible materials should be kept clear of the engine at all times.<br>
Beware of the danger of moving parts, especially drive belts, when the engine is
running.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Care should be taken
against spillage when filling the diesel tank via the deck filler. It is
recommended that the adjacent scupper should be blocked with an oil-absorbing
pad when filling is in progress. A no-smoking rule should be observed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Electrical system:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">An isolating switch is
provided on the battery compartment. The system may be shut off by switching to
the &quot;off&quot; position. Postion &quot;1&quot; switches on the house
batteries and position &quot;2&quot; switches on the starter battery. Position
&quot;All&quot; switches on both the starter battery and the house batteries. A
digital charging controller (Echo-charge) is also fitted. This device ensures
that when the engine is running the alternator output first goes to the starter
battery to re-charge it, then automatically switches to the house battery when
it detects that the starter battery is full. The device also protects the
alternator from diode damage whenever the electrical system is shut off with the
engine still running.<br>
<br>
Charging is provided by four sources:<br>
1. Solar panel. This has its own regulator and requires no adjustment.<br>
2. Wind generator. This has its own regulator and requires no adjustment.<br>
3. Engine alternator. Output is regulated by a three-stage regulator mounted to
port in the engine compartment. Consult the manufacturer's handbook for voltage
and time settings (dependent on requirements and operating temperatures etc).<br>
4. Shorepower charger. Plugs into 110v outlet in quarterberth bulkhead.<br>
<br>
Shorepower: There are seven 110v outlets. These may be connected by either the
provided 110V yellow cable with connectors and adaptors, or by the 240v - 110V
transformer, depending on where the boat is operating.<br>
<br>
Battery electrolyte should be regularly checked. Naked flame should not be
allowed near the batteries when they are being filled.<br>
The digital e-meter should be checked frequently to monitor battery performance.
House batteries should not be drawn down to less than 50 percent of capacity
(preferably not less than 65 percent) to maintain their working life. <br>
When removing a battery, first disconnect the positive connection, followed by
the negative. When replacing batteries, ensure that the battery boxes are clean
and dry, that the lids are in place and that the security bar and strap are
securely fixed. <br>
The battery-box ventilation grilles should be kept clear at all times.<br>
The electrical system is protected by a 250-amp fuse, located in the battery box
at the front top. The electrical system must be switched off during the changing
of the fuse.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Batt-box diagram</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Gas system:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2" color="#808000"><b>Remember
that propane and butane gases are heavier than air and collect at the lowest
point on the boat, presenting the most serious explosion hazard. Scrupulous
attention to use of gas and all combustible materials is vital aboard the boat
at all times. Fire is one of the chief hazards aboard a boat. </b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">An isolated gas locker is
provided in the stern. Propane/butane bottles should be stored in this locker
and nowhere else on the boat. The locker is vented by a drain hole at the
bottom. This hole should be checked to make sure it is always clear. <b><br>
</b>The gas cooker in the galley is the only device connected to the gas bottle.
Gas pipe runs should be machine-crimped at their ends. Pipe runs should be
continuous, unjointed lengths of appropriate gas hose between the regulator and
the cooker.<br>
The appropriate regulator must be used for either propane or butane supply.<br>
The gas system is controlled by a 12v solenoid, situated in the gas locker. The
solenoid is activated a control panel situated to the rear of the galley area.
If 12v power fails or is deliberately switched off, the solenoid will close and
shut off the gas supply. <br>
A gas detector is mounted at floor level at the foot of the engine hatch, next
to the cooker. If the detector detects an accumulation of propane or butane --
and many other combustible gases&nbsp; -- a loud warning buzzer will sound and
the gas supply will be shut down by the solenoid. The system should be checked
before the supply is switched on again. See manufacturer's instructions.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Volatile flammable
materials should not be stored near the cooker or in the bilge.<b><br>
<br>
Saloon heater:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">The saloon heater operates
on diesel. It is supplied from a diesel fuel tank house in the cockpit locker.
Consult the manufacturer's operating and safety instructions. Spare fuel should
be stored only in designated diesel containers and kept away from naked flame.<br>
The heater fuel line runs through the bilge to a filter combined with an on/off
switch at the forward end. A fan is fitted to the heater for use in windy
conditions.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Fire-fighting equipment:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Two 2.25kg dry-powder fire
extinguishers are provided. One is housed in the saloon by the galley bulkhead,
port side, and one on the forepeak bulkhead, starboard side.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Means of fire escape:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Escape may be made via the
forehatch over the forepeak, the main hatch over the saloon, and by the
companionway doors.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Boat handling:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">The maximum engine power
should not exceed 25.74kw</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Consult the engine
manufacturer's handbook before starting the engine. Check that docks lines and
shorepower connections are free before moving off the dock.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Emergency steering
device:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">An emergency tiller is
provided in case of wheel steering failure. It is kept in the hanging locker in
the saloon and is fitted by removing the bronze deck plate aft in the cockpit. A
key is stored in the lower companionway locker.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2"><b>Safe operation:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Lifeline gates should be
kept closed when the boat is at sea. Personal flotation devices with safety
harness should be worn at all times. A Lifesaver buoy and line are kept on the
stern rail. A boarding ladder is kept in the cockpit locker for attachment to
the gate stanchions on either side of the boat. Jacklines are provided for
operation of the boat in rough weather. It is recommended that they should
always be used for night passages. It is recommended that a tackle, at least
four-part, is kept stowed on the lifelines amidships during passages for
attachment to a halyard to enable a man overboard to be hoisted from the
sea.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">A liferaft cradle for a
hard canister is fitted on top of the main hatch cover.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Engine parts should be
given a safe berth during operation.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">The propellor is an area of
extreme danger when the engine is running.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Navigation lights are
operated from the panel by the navigation desk.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Areas in which combustible
fuels are being burned should be properly ventilated at all times.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">All equipment should be
properly stowed when the boat is under way. Working areas, particularly the
cockpit and foredeck, should be kept tidy and free of clutter.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">The toilet empties solely
into the holding tank. It can not be emptied direct to sea. The holding tank may
be pumped out to sea by switching the Y-valve and operating the hand-pump
located in the head sink-unit, or via the starboard deck pump-out deck-plate.</font></p>
