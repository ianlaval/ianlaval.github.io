  <p class="MsoNormal">San Andres, Caribbean,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>May 22.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Hello, Friends:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">It’s early morning and the sky’s a little clearer,
  though still with heavy banks of graying cumulus cloud. Yesterday’s<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>torrential thunderstorm has departed, leaving the air a little fresher,
  though it’s still hot and pretty windless. The sea’s<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>barely rippled. When I’ve finished my pre-breakfast cup of tea I’ll
  tune into the SSB weatherfax from the New Orleans tropical prediction center
  and see what’s on the cards for tomorrow and the next leg north up the
  Caribbean..</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">San Andres, where we’ve been for the last five days, is
  a Colombian-owned island stopping-stone 250 miles north of Panama, on the edge
  of the shallow, reef-filled waters off the coast of Nicaragua. It’s a
  holiday isle, as the jet-skis that zip around Lydia’s anchorage off the Club
  Nautico remind us. Never mind the funfair, though ;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>San Andres has ice, which we ran out of over a week ago. Since Lydia B
  has no fridge, that’s been the pit of deprivation in these days of 90F and
  sticky, energy-sapping humidity. It’s bad enough climbing into a sodden bunk
  every night, but to have no cold drinks…..</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">And San Andres has shops galore – though most of them
  are stocked with a strange array of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tommy
  Hilfiger fashion clothes mixed with pots, pans and allegedly duty-free TV’s
  and washing machines aimed at holiday-makers from the Colombian mainland.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Yes – we’re now on the Atlantic side of the Panama
  Canal, heading for Florida and the US east coast, looking over our shoulder
  for the first signs of the hurricane season on our tail. Strings of tropical
  waves marching from east to west further south below us – the first signs of
  future cyclonic weather activity – remind us not to dally. We’re about a
  month behind schedule. Not too bad in the way of things, as most sailors would
  tell you. But I’ll be happier when we’ve got the next 800 miles behind us
  and we’re within spitting distance of hurricane protection on the US
  mainland.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">So – Rachel newly back from Wisconsin -- we finally
  transited the canal after two week’s delay at Balboa. Hung with old car
  tyres for protection in the locks alongside the fearsome big ships, and
  weighed down with four extra hired line-handlers, two Canal Authority advisers
  (a pilot and his understudy), plus cold drinks and hot curry ready for lunch
  for all aboard en route, we got through the three sets of locks and two lakes
  – 50 miles from Pacific to Atlantic – in the day and without mishap. From
  the astonishing engineering seen from above and from the bottom of the locks<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>to the crocodile on the mudbank, the monkeys in the trees and the
  strange birds aloft, it was – for US$650 and much nail-chewing – a
  ringside seat at a truly amazing show.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A few fly-ridden days anchored at Cristobal, and having
  ventured as far as the post office in Colon -- school for half the world’s
  muggers by all accounts --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>then
  Lydia headed out against the westbound tradewinds<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>to go to the San Blas islands, 70 miles east of the canal and home to
  the Kuna Indian people. It’s hard to describe San Blas in a couple of
  sentences; but they’d have include the clearest water we’ve ever seen,
  coral and amazing underwater fish life, coconut palms and white sand just like
  the Bounty bar ad, lovely, friendly people, lobster galore – and molas.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Molas are the colourful, hand-sewn patchwork fabrics
  depicting Kuna life that are still worn by all the Kuna women, and which they
  are adept at selling to visiting boats, sometimes with a little barter trade
  for coffee, milk powder, soap and such. Their craftsmanship is high, and we
  must now have a collection of a score or so to add to the Woonan indian
  carvings, shells, cocabola timber etc that now cram Lydia’s dwindling space.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Sadly, my digital camera went the way of so many things
  electronic on the rough, two-day sail from San Blas to San Andres. Lydia got
  thrown about and sea-water dripped into the quarter-berth, scoring a hit on
  the faithful Olympus when it rolled out of its bag. I have e-mailable pictures
  up to San Andres, but from now on it’s back to the old 35mm.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Today we’ll decide on the next leg of the passage
  north.We’re still with Indara, the boat from Washington state we met way
  back in Pacific Mexico; and there are new buddies<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>now – Dalliance and Restless, both heading for the United States.
  They’re 35 and 37-footers, so Lydia’s still the baby of the bunch. Next
  stop Isla Mujeres in the Mexican Yucatan.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Love &amp; best wishes,<br>
  Ian &amp; Rachel,<br>
  Lydia B.</p>

        </span>N21.14, W086.44.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Hello, Friends:</p>
  </center>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">We’re back in Mexico. After the long haul down
        the desolate Baja and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mexico’s
        Pacific coast&nbsp;<br>
 in January &amp; February, this is a fleeting glimpse of<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>a different Mexican face, the Caribbean one. We’re in the
        land of the Mayas. The place is different, and so are the people.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">We’re also in holiday-ville. We can see Cancun,
        one of the world’s major package tourist traps,&nbsp;<br>
 a few miles ashore
        from Lydia B’s island anchorage. All day the fast and slow ferries
        bundle visitors in and out of Isla Mujeres to spend<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>their pesos and dollars in the mile or so of narrow streets that
        seem to contain little else but tourist trinket shops – woven fabrics,
        silver jewellery&nbsp;<br>
 and the renowned Yucatan hammocks. We joined the throng
        and bought our share. We now&nbsp;<br>
 have a hammock each, to string between the
        forestay and the shrouds and hang around Mexican style. They’re
        old-fashioned ones, made of woven hemp. We even bought a shark’s-tooth
        necklace -- though we have our own shark’s teeth, taken from a dead
        hammerhead shark&nbsp;<br>
 beached at Cayo Vivorillo, our last idyllic coral
        island stop 400 miles or so back.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">By now, of course, we’re less than 400 miles from
        the United States – and 100 miles from Cuba. And nearly 6,000 miles
        from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where Lydia B started her
        voyage down the Pacific last September. Central America and the Panama
        Canal are nearly&nbsp;<br>
 behind us and our own culture beckons again. We’re
        already mentally changing gear, and wondering apprehensively how we’ll
        take to the different way of life. We’ve filled up again with water,
        stores and diesel – slack winds and calm seas in this period between
        the strong Caribbean tradewinds&nbsp;<br>
 and the arrival of the hurricane season
        means we’ve had to use the iron genny a good deal.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Already the squalls are increasing and tropical
        waves, birthplace of future seasonal hurricanes, are marching westwards
        across the Atlantic to the southern Caribbean just above the Equator.
        They’ll creep north as the summer advances, until by August they’ll
        spawn cyclones. We’re pretty safe&nbsp;<br>
 yet, but it’s an uncomfortable
        feeling and we want to be on our way. We’ll feel safer when we reach
        the Chesapeake, north of the Carolinas and another 1,500 miles or so
        from here. We’ll sail for Key West, Florida, later today.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Meanwhile Lydia B has used up one of her nine
        lives. (We’re confident that like cats, boats have these). Half-way
        between Cayo Vivorillo and Isla Mujeres, 120 miles out into the
        Caribbean, a through-hull fitting – the one containing the knot-meter
        – collapsed, leaving an inch-and-a-quarter hole in the hull two feet
        below water-level. By sheer chance, we were on the spot when it happened
        and got a wooden bung in before much water flooded in.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">For a brief, chastening moment we were looking at
        undersea sunlight through a hole in the boat. It was one of those
        traumatic occasions when much time passes in split seconds. We’re now
        examining the remains of the through-hull to see why it happened. The
        bung will stay in place, safely, we think, until Lydia comes out of the
        water in the US and we can make a permanent&nbsp;<br>
 repair. Ask us now if we
        believe in good fairies.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">We’re a bit behind with pictures. These cover
        Lydia B’s transit of the Panama Canal and ten days or so in the San
        Blas Islands before we set out on the passage north from Panama.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Love &amp; Best wishes,<br>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Hello,
        Friends,</font></p>
  <center>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">They
        say events are character-forming. I’m writing this on my lap-top in
        the departure lounge of Nassau airport. That’s right -- Nassau in the
        Bahamas. I should be in Key West, Florida at the nav table on Lydia B,
        where all the rest of these Lydialog chapters<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>have&nbsp;<br>
 been written.<br>
        I’m on my way home (to Lydia, that is) after traumatic events in the
        last three days. Briefly, your skipper was brusquely ejected from the US
        of A within 36 hours of arriving at Key West, Florida by a gun-toting,
        hard-staring, deaf-to-any-appeal blonde lady representing the&nbsp;<br>
 teeth of
        the feared American immigration service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I’m now a wrong-doer with a finger-printed record. I was stood
        up against a brown immigration office door and mug-shot like the wanted
        September 11 New York bombers whose photos adorn the adjacent wall of
        the same office. If I wasn’t a journalist looking for good copy, I’d
        be&nbsp;<br>
 stung. Right now I’m on mental overdrive, tired, a bit miffed and
        non-plussed. Thank goodness I’m not a criminal. Or maybe I am?</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">But
        let me go back a bit, because the last you heard from Lydia B was from
        Isla Mujeres, island outpost of the Mexican Yucatan. We left there last
        Thursday afternoon, taking advantage of a coming break in the series of
        Caribbean thunder squalls that will from&nbsp;<br>
 now on increase until
        full-scale hurricanes arrive from sometime soon until November.&nbsp;<br>
 They
        give them nice, cosy names like Henrietta and George, but there’s very
        little that’s&nbsp;<br>
 cosy about them. The first two or three days were quiet
        as Lydia B sailed and motored<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>in
        a near-absence of wind across the Yucatan Straight, then 50 miles off
        the northwest coast of Cuba. Currents were supposed to be with us, but
        we never found them. As we entered&nbsp;<br>
 the Florida Straight and neared Key
        West on Sunday night we switched onto the newly within-range VHF weather
        broadcasts of the United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
        Administration (NOAA). NOAA does a great job of forecasting weather for
        sailors, and it’s been good to be back listening to that stacatto,
        automated voice out at sea. You get to like it as the voice of a
        slightly retarded but very helpful friend.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Anyway,
        we could see on Lydia’s port bow a building mass of black cloud over
        the Florida Keys and knew something was brewing. In the night-time
        darnkness these clouds look sinister and unreal. They have an ominous
        shape, billowing grey-black, blotting out the&nbsp;<br>
 stars that reassure us we’re
        going in the right direction, dense rain-squalls shafting to sea-level
        which we pick up on the radar. Sometimes you can see them far enough
        ahead to steer round them. Sometimes they’re so big and develop so
        quickly you can’t get out of the way. Next we were listening to a
        special NOAA storm warning of gale-force winds, deadly lightning
        strikes, very heavy rain and waterspouts. Already tired after three
        nights at sea, we battened down for an onslaught, reefing just in time
        before it hit us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Our
        only hope was that the storm was moving west. We were towards its
        eastern end, and moving north-east, though battling a 3-knot west-going
        current counter to the infant Gulf Stream emerging the Gulf of Mexico.
        But these storms are generally short-lived and we were lucky. The bulk
        of it crossed Lydia’s bow and we escaped with a lashing from its
        eastern edge, illuminated by immense lightning flashes. We got thrown
        about a bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>One entire bookshelf disgorged itself onto the cabin floor and
        salt somehow penetrated where there was no conceivable way in. But we
        emerged safely into daylight ten miles south of the&nbsp;<br>
 main shipping
        channel into Key West. The sun rose, Lydia shook out her mainsail reefs,
        flew her yankee headsail again and galloped up the bright, buoyed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>channel through water pale blue from sky and sand, alongside a
        big white cruise ship heading for Key West to disgorge yet another load
        of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>overnight trippers. They
        lined the rails to photograph Lydia as the ship overtook us. Did they
        wish they were sailing on our adventurous little boat rather than the
        big, comfortable liner?</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Pretty
        well exhausted, we dropped the hook off Wisteria Island opposite town,
        called up&nbsp;<br>
 the US coastguard on the VHF to ask about entry formalities to
        the United States and – well, that’s when things took off.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Clearance
        formalities are done with the US Customs, who issue a cruising permit
        for the boat, with the Department of Agriculture who vet incoming fruit
        and veg (we surrendered<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>all
        ours – Mexican oranges, onions, tomatoes and garlic); and with the
        Department of Immigration, who guard the many scattered gates of this
        immense, cosmopolitan country against undesirable intruders. They do
        their job with the unsmiling, unsentimental,&nbsp;<br>
 unhearing dedication of a
        pack of Weimaraners. It’s the cold unsmilingness that hits a lazy,&nbsp;<br>
        laissez-faire English person like me. It’s struck me with sudden
        clarity, three years into North American life, that there really is a
        difference between national cultures, and it’s to be&nbsp;<br>
 found somewhere,
        chillingly, here. In the last few days I’ve felt a new affinity with
        my European – I think it’s that, not just English – roots.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">So
        here I am, newly arrived in America – with US citizen Rachel
        alongside, knocking on the immigration office door, passport ingenuously
        in hand, voluntarily reporting our arrival in&nbsp;<br>
 the United States and
        seeking permission to cruise up the East coast. On the other side of&nbsp;<br>
 the
        split, counter-top door is a woman in white T-shirt with INS INSPECTOR
        in big letters on the back, macho navy blue heavy cotton shorts
        festooned with bulging patch pockets&nbsp;<br>
 and crotch creases and white,
        turned-up running shoes. She has straight, blonde hair and&nbsp;<br>
 I’d guess
        is about early forties. Her waist is hung with a stiff black leather
        belt containing holstered revolver (soon I haven’t the faintest doubt
        she’d use it), several ammunition pouches, cell-phone (or phones) and
        gas or pepper spray. I can’t quite decide if her look is mean or
        worried. I’m scrutinizing her for evidence of femininity. Her posture
        is more that of&nbsp;<br>
 a hunting male panther, with dandruff. She doesn’t
        walk; she swaggers to impress.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">So
        far, I haven’t a clue what’s about to happen. Panther-woman keeps
        our passports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rachel’s
        is cleared, but not mine, though she doesn’t hand it back to Rachel
        yet. Stapled inside mine is a US 90-day visa-waiver from August 2001,
        which I should have handed in when I left the USA on the way down the
        Pacific coast from Canada to Mexico. I didn’t, so (says panther lady)
        I was illegally in the United States from mid-November to January 21,
        when I sailed south from California. Quite erroneously, the valid
        six-month cruising permit issued in Washington State, way back up the
        Pacific, had managed to convince me my presence was legal. More than
        this, says panther lady, I didn’t have a current visa to&nbsp;<br>
 re-enter the
        United States. (British citizens don’t need one, but I discover they
        do if they&nbsp;<br>
 arrive by private boat. If they’re heard at all, these
        rules are whispered, not shouted).</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Panther lady
        steps aside to make out-of-earshot phone calls to head office, returns
        and announces I have to leave the country immediately.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">I
        can choose either to leave on Lydia B, given a few hours to re-provision
        and escorted to the 12-mile limit by the US coast guard, or I can fly
        out of the country. ‘But my boat; it’s my home….?’ – ‘You
        WILL be leaving by tomorrow night….’ Not a trace of sympathy, no
        feminine softness. This lady’s in command of the trees.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">It
        takes a while for things like this to sink in, back on Lydia B, anchored
        just off town, overnight. I keep thinking: they just want to scare me.
        We’ll go in tomorrow and they’ll&nbsp;<br>
 wag a stern finger and say they’ve
        decided to issue a visa after all. They’ll see I’m a&nbsp;<br>
 harmless
        pensioner.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">In
        the morning we’re again chasing up flights to Nassau on the internet,
        car hire&nbsp;<br>
 companies for the drive from Key West to Miami, Greyhound buses
        and the US Embassy in Nassau. Will I get a visa quickly – or at all?
        Isn’t there an outside chance I won’t be&nbsp;<br>
 allowed back into the
        United States and I’ll be parted for good from Lydia B, left with
        Rachel alone on board? What then? Panther woman has neither guarantees
        nor visible concern. I keep asking questions, meekly suggesting that
        although I accept I’ve broken&nbsp;<br>
 the rules, I haven’t done much harm.
        Goodness, I’m a pensioner these last four days, fresh from my 65<sup>th</sup> 
        birthday at sea. Panther-woman pokes her face at me and warns me –
        B-movie-style – she’s getting upset. That’s the last thing, I
        guess, you want to make an immigration inpector do. I shut up.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">At
        last we find a flight from Miami to Nassau and book it. I have to pay
        for it when I get to Miami airport. Not good enough, says Ms immigration
        lady. She phones the airline herself. I have to pay for the flight
        before I leave Key West. She wants to see the ticket. Can’t, says the
        airline. Go and find a local travel agent, says the blonde panther; book
        it again. Which we do, then return and show her the ticket. Then, having
        hired a car and tossed a few things into a back-pack, we abandon Lydia B
        on her anchor-chain and drive to Miami, Rachel at the wheel. It’s a
        beautiful drive up the Florida Keys. But is this the last time I’ll
        see&nbsp;<br>
 it – or Lydia B? Of course not. I’m dramatizing. Which is
        exactly what you do in these circumstances.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Soon
        I’m in the air, then I’m giving my late-night story to the Bahamian
        immigration service at Nassau airport. There’s a problem -- there’s
        no US stamp in my passport to account for&nbsp;<br>
 my provenance. The Bahamians
        sympathise, are friendly and give me ten days to get the&nbsp;<br>
 US visa. An
        officer finds me somewhere to stay. I bed down after midnight in a
        seedy,&nbsp;<br>
 empty hotel – “under new management” (though that seems to
        be a total staff of one mildly-spoken, polite Indian gentleman from, he
        says, Madras. Don’t tell me any more that national cultures aren’t
        different.) near the centre of Nassau, just round the corner from the
        American embassy. No tea, but I manage to get a cup of lukewarm coffee
        and a shower. The Hilton’s on the opposite side of the road. But the
        sheets are clean – and anyway, I’m bushed.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">In
        the morning as I’m collecting up my overnight things there’s a huge
        thunderstorm. Nassau roads are awash. I’ll get drenched on the
        200-yard walk to the embassy. It isn’t a very encouraging self-image.
        I see myself dripping onto the embassy carpet, belongings in&nbsp;<br>
 a white
        cloth shopping bag, pleading to be let into the United States. They’ll
        already have seen my criminal record on the computer. Panther lady will
        have made sure. I’m tired, hungry, homeless and disorientated, like
        the bag-lady on the streets of London.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">I
        get to the visa application office five minutes before official opening
        time, open the door – and an confronted by a sea of queueing Bahamians
        all after the same vital piece of paper as me. It’s going to take ages
        to deal with all these people. My hopes for a return to Miami on the
        five o’clock flight that afternoon plummet. Or is it just because I’m
        tired and short of food? I fill in the visa form and hand it in with $65
        dollars. Yesterday it was $45; it’s gone up just because I’m bad. In
        answer to the form’s question ‘Have you ever been refused entry to
        the United States?’ I say ‘yes’.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">There’s
        a 20-minute wait. The Bahamians seem to be getting their visas and
        leaving one by one. No word of mine. I’ll never see Lydia again. Then
        a female voice comes over the loudspeaker – ‘Ian Laval. Please go to
        window three.’</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">It’s
        an older State Department official. She has my forms. But she’s
        smiling. How I need that smile! She asks what I’m doing in North
        America. Sailing a boat from British Columbia to England, I say. She
        smiles again. I gobble it up. She points to my answer about being&nbsp;<br>
        refused entry, and I recount the previous two days’ events at the Key
        West immigration office. She checks the computer and seems already to
        know. ‘Why…….?’ she begins, then pauses and seems to want to
        tell me she’s surprised I was summarily thrown out. She can’t, of
        course. Then, pointing to my Cumbrian origins on the application form
        – “ Do you know Carlisle Castle? I was there two years ago. I was
        posted to the embassy in London”. Crisis over. My hopes soar. Somebody’s
        human. My visa is ready ten minutes later and I walk out onto the
        streets of central Nassau. There are still huge puddles, but the rain’s
        stopped. I’m&nbsp;<br>
 in a typical English town, where traffic drives on the
        left and friendly, white-jacketed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>policemen,
        with no guns, saunter in pairs along the pavements of The Bay, the main
        shopping street. I’m no longer a bag-lady. Somebody wants me.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">I
        have a beer and a burger at the Pirate Bar and make the airport in
        plenty of time for the 5.0pm back to Miami. It’s delayed an hour –
        but what does that matter? I’ve e-mailed Rachel, who’s driving the
        140 miles again from Key West to meet me, having dealt the previous
        night with her own crisis aboard Lydia. A Canadian boat dragged its
        anchor and drifted into Lydia’s bow, being stopped just after
        colliding with Lydia’s bowsprit. Lydia took it on the chin. There’s
        no damage, except to nerves.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">We’re
        back on Lydia by midnight. Legitimate.</font></p>

        southerly winds and heavy rain continue and Lydia’s bouncing around on
        her anchor-chain.We’ve had another wicked line-squall this afternoon.
        Torrential rain driven by a 40-knot wind blotted out virtually all
        visibility. Caught in a strong tidal current at her anchorage off Key
        West, Lydia didn’t know which way to point, to the wind or the stream,
        and we stood ready in case she waltzed her anchor out of the sand. But
        she didn’t. The thunder’s still rolling around.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="2">In

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b>Vero Beach, Florida, Saturday June
        22/02.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Hello, Friends:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Feeling a bit poor and want to know where all your
        money went? Take a look down here.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Lydia B’s now sailing (chiefly with
        the iron genny, that is) up the Intra-Coastal Waterway, a sort&nbsp;<br>
 of ditch
        inside the US east coast that takes you in relative safety from the
        weather as far as North Carolina and the Chesapeake. I’d call it a
        canal, but that gives no impression of the mind-boggling private wealth
        lining its southern banks. The buildings and boats you pass for hundreds
        of Florida miles are anything but derelict industrial warehouses and
        rusting coal-barges.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The glitz began at Miami, where we
        arrived at the end of a tough, offshore passage from Key West, riding
        the Gulf Stream flowing north-east outside the reef that guards the
        southern tip of this orange-growing holiday state. Short of somewhere to
        anchor, we tied up at a marina beneath the sky-gazing hotel blocks of
        Miami Beach. Clean, white concrete (even if it was behind locked
        security gates), someone to take a line as we approached and tied up
        Mediterranean-style&nbsp;<br>
 between wooden piles, a shower ashore for the first
        time in ages – we’ve been so long at sea,&nbsp;<br>
 living continuously with
        sticky sweat. And a deli a few yards away for coffee and a croissant
        next morning before pulling out, past the city-centre dockyards, the
        maze of route marker posts – red triangles to port, green squares to
        starboard – on up the ICW. It’s all so different.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Across a confusing waterway junction
        in downtown Miami, Lydia B pushed through town by&nbsp;<br>
 wind and tide,
        searching for the correct exit before we miss it and all the time
        watching the depth gauge – shoals and shallow water in the ICW are the
        daily problem now – and soon we’re rounding the bend to the
        Rickenbacker Highway Bridge, with a main-road span 76 feet over the
        water – plenty of height for Lydia B – then the Venetian Causeway
        highway bridge, the first of dozens of lifting bridges (mostly bascule
        and double bascule, as they’re correctly called). We call the
        bridge-keeper up on VHF channel 9 and ask him or her to let us past. “Come
        right on down and we’ll get you through.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We say a “thankyou. Lydia B standing by zero nine.” We’ve
        by now got our radio patter pretty sharp. Bells clang, road barriers
        come down, traffic stops – country&nbsp;<br>
 lane or Highway Route 1, it makes
        no difference – the bridge lifts and Lydia B, all 50 feet of her from
        sea to mast-top radio aerial go through the bridge and we call a radio
        thanks or wave to the keeper looking down from the turret before there’s
        another bell-clanging and the bridge closes. It works like clockwork,
        even for this insignificant little ship. This is America.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">So far we’ve touched bottom only
        once, pushed aside by a speeding powerboat that bounced us with its wake
        and dropped Lydia B onto her bottom as we edged out of the way to the
        side of the channel. But the bottom’s soft mud and it was a gentle
        reminder not to be so English polite. As I say, this is America.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Vero Beach, where we are now, is a
        typical, municipally-owned marina. We’re on a mooring&nbsp;<br>
 buoy for eight
        dollars a night – though we have the use of showers and washing
        machines etc ashore, plus unlimited access to midges (no-see-ums) from
        the neighbouring mangroves. They&nbsp;<br>
 pack a fearful punch and just love this
        still, damp air, so we’ve got bug-netting up and a citronella candle
        in the cockpit. In fact it’s critter-ville on Lydia B at the moment.
        We’ve had an infestation&nbsp;<br>
 of cockroaches, probably brought aboard with
        the groceries. Swatting them’s a waste of time – they’re greased
        lightning and seem to be able to tune into your attack mode before you
        can lift a hand. So we’ve got cotton-wool balls soaked in insecticide
        in locker-bottoms, plus a dozen roach hotels stuck up round the boat.
        The idea is that they scurry out for a quick meal and don’t live to
        regret it. I think we might be winning.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">We’ve got rid of our accumulated
        rubbish (garbage) – a constant problem on a travelling boat (that’s
        ‘traveling’ to North Americans. Even the language is different). We’ll
        fill up with diesel and water (no longer having to worry if the water’s
        drinkable. It’s America), empty the sewage holding tank (which we
        usually do out at sea, but not in the ICW, where it’s illegal anyway)
        at the marina pump-out and be on our way northwards tomorrow. Soon we’ll
        be in Georgia, then the Carolinas, North and South, listening intently
        to NOAA weather radio for the possibility of<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>cyclonic weather in the distance and keeping an eye open for
        bolt-holes to batten down in. They take hurricanes seriously round here.
        I’ll be glad to reach the Chesapeake.</p>
