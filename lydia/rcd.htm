<p>The Baba 30 is a heavy displacement, full-keeled, double-ended cutter
designed by Robert H. Perry of Seattle, Washington, USA for long-distance,
bluewater voyaging. Some 230 Baba 30-s were built between 1977 and 1985 by the
Ta Shing Yacht Building Company, Tainan, Taiwan, to standards at or exceeding
Lloyds. Lydia B, hull no. 61, was built in 1979.</p>
<p>Perry (<a href="http://www.perryboat.com">www.perryboat.com)</a> is the designer of the Baba 30 (a few were sold in the UK as the

<u>
<p>Lydia B history.</p>
</u>
<p>Lydia B was built and fitted out by Ta Shing and first delivered to Juneau,
Alaska, in 1979.</p>
<p>Until 2001 she remained in the Pacific Northwest, principally in the Seattle,
Washington area. Ian Laval bought the boat in British Columbia, Canada, in 1999 and took it to Victoria
BC. She was registered in the UK in 1999 and has been a live-aboard boat for 12 years of her life,
voyaging extensively in the Pacific Northwest, Caribbean and
Atlantic. She has sailed the Inside Passage to the far north of British Columbia
and
completed three circumnavigations of Vancouver Island. Since 1999 to date (2004)
Ian Laval has lived aboard and equipped the vessel for independent,
long-distance passage-making. He chose the Baba 30 after another Atlantic
passage in a different, 34-ft boat and has sailed Lydia B 18,000nm, including Pacific and
transatlantic passages in a wide spectrum of conditions with no
failure of boat or equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lydia B has encountered many ocean gales, tropical thunderstorms and a Force
11 Atlantic storm (see attached log, relevant NOAA W/fax and account).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Principal passages 1999-2004.</p>
<p>Jun 2000: Circumnavigation Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada (900nm)</p>
<p>May/Jul 2001: Victoria BC via Inside Passage to northern British Columbia,
Queen Charlotte Is, Victoria BC. (1,700nm)</p>
<p>Sept 2001: Victoria BC to San Diego, S. California (1,550nm)</p>
<p>Jan 2002: San Diego, California to Panama via Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua
and Costa Rica (3,400nm)</p>
<p>Apr 2002: Panama via Caribbean (San Andres &amp; Isla Mujeres) to Washington
DC, Chesapeake, east US (3,200nm)</p>
<p>Jun 2003: Virginia US to Maryport, Cumbria, UK via Azores: 4,080nm)</p>
</font>
<p>(<font FACE="Century Gothic" SIZE="2">Details of the above passages and recorded weather below are in Lydia B’s
log).</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Century Gothic" SIZE="2">
<p><br>
</font></b><font FACE="Century Gothic" SIZE="2">
<b>Lydia B</b>  encountered the normal wide variety of weather from calms to
Force 11 storm on her most recent 15,000nm ocean passage from the Pacific
Northwest to the UK. Heavy weather included:</p>
<p>Oct 2/01. N46 124W (off Oregon USA): gale.</p>
<p>Gulf of Papagayo, Nicaragua, Mar 20-24 2002 – continuous Papagayo winds to
40kts.</p>
<p>June 8-9 2002 N23.50 W083.11 (off W.Cuba) -- tropical storm.</p>
<p>May 31-June 1 2003 N37.00 W67.30 (Atlantic) -- storm. Recorded wind 61kts,</p>
<p>seas 30 to 45ft. (see NOAA surface analysis w/fax below).</p>
<p>Jul 6 2003: N45.59 W16.13 (Atlantic) -- gale</p>
<u>
<p>Account of Atlantic Force 11 storm encountered by Lydia B on May 31/June 1
2003 at N37.00 67.30W.</p>
</u>
<p>Boston NMF Atlantic surface analysis weatherfax six hours post- storm-height
transmitted on June 1, 2003. Lydia B’s position was approx. N37.00
69.00W, 550nm east of the Chesapeake, US, in the storm’s SE quadrant.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><br>
<img border="0" src="images/storm1f.jpg" width="439" height="469"></p>
<p>Lydia B’s position and the conditions can be verified by the Canadian mv <i>Oleander</i>
and the Bermuda-registered ketch <i>Wings of Time</i>. VHF contact was logged
with both vessels at 1900gmt on May 31 and 0800gmt on June 1 respectively.</p>
<p>The storm developed with a rapid and unpredicted fall in pressure to 976mb
and reached its height overnight at 0600GMT on June 1. Breaking seas can only be
guessed at, but were probably between 35ft and 45ft, exacerbated by the boat’s
position near the outer wall of a SSE-bound Gulf Stream current in opposition to
the wind.</p>
<p>Lydia B lay hove-to with storm jib and minimum reefed main and the wheel
braked and lashed for four hours. The 2 crew remained below with companionway
washboards in place. Breaking waves repeatedly crashed over the port side. The
starboard portlights were regularly under solid water and the starboard deck was
submerged for long periods. No water entered the boat and she did not feel
stressed. All systems, including navigation lights, VHF and SSB radios, all
electrical systems, engine, steering and rig remained fully functioning.</p>
<p>At first light, past the storm’s height, all sail was removed and Lydia B
ran under bare pole for several hours in very big following and breaking seas,
steered continuously by the Monitor wind-vane at speeds routinely of eight
knots. Although Lydia B carried a 4.57m parachute and 120m of heavy line it was
not felt necessary to deploy it. It was considered wiser to escape the influence
of the Gulf-stream current. The boat handled comfortably with major wind and
seas astern on the starboard quarter and did not attempt to broach. Boarding
cross-waves frequently filled the cockpit, knocking down the helmsman, and
draining quickly.</p>
<p>No damage to the boat, rig or systems was sustained. The cockpit lee-cloths
were shredded by the force of the wind. Several items of spares were washed off
the deck or floated out of the cockpit. Lydia B continued her passage
uneventfully to Horta, Azores and thence to the UK.</p>
<p><a href="stormlogs.htm">Storm logs transmitted ashore by HF radio e-mail June
1/2-03.</a></p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>Sole equipment failures on the 15,000nm passage from the NW Pacific to the UK
were to a mainsail damaged in an accidental heavy weather gybe off Mexico and a
worn seal on the Yanmar engine’s salt-water pump while moored in the Azores.</p>
<p>The Panama Canal is a severe test of a small vessel’s mooring points during
transit when large prop-washes are encountered from freighters in the locks.
Many vessels have been severely damaged. Lydia B transited the Canal without
incident.</p>
<p>A feature of the Baba 30 is its small cockpit, designed to minimize potential
problems caused by boarding seas. No sea-water has entered the interior of the
boat in the current owner’s 18,000nm of open-ocean voyaging, except in the
normal way into the bilge via the stuffing box</p>

under motor alone is 5.5kts at 2,400 revs. Overall average speed over last
15,000nm: 4.3 kts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.1</b><u><b>. Engine and engine spaces.</b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/engine.jpg" width="580" height="244"></p>
</u>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diesel engine is a 21.33KW Yanmar 3GM30F fresh-water cooled unit. It was
installed in 1997 and has run for 2,900 hours (June 2004).</p>
<p>The manufacturer’s handbook and a full Yanmar workshop manual are provided.</p>
<p>The engine is located under a removable teak hatch beneath the companionway.
The hatch is fitted with two inspection panels – one above and one to the
starboard side. The hatch may be lifted off for complete engine access. The
hatch is lined with non-combustible material. The engine is on rubber mounts
bolted to grp-covered teak stringers glassed to the hull. A white plastic pan is
beneath. All essential service parts are accessible, including oil and fuel
filters, dipstick and oil evacuation point, alternator, water-pumps and drive
belts.</p>
<p>Fuel hoses are fire-resistant. A 127-ltr diesel tank is described in 5.2
below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.2 </b><u><b>Fuel system</b></p>
</u>
<p>A 127-ltr diesel tank is located in the bilge immediately forward of the
engine. The tank is fabricated in steel plate to fit the bilge space. The tank
was removed for inspection in March 2004, pressure-cleaned internally,
shot-blasted externally and re-epoxied.</p>
<p>The tank contains one lateral baffle and has a 300mm x 200mm inspection plate
with neoprene gasket.</p>
<p>Provision is made in a recess at the forward end of the tank for 50mm filler
pipe and a breather pipe, to plates above-deck on the port side amidships. A
recess at the after end of the tank contains the fuel feed to the engine, the
return from the injectors and a dipstick. The tank is secured in the bilge by
two oak battens screwed to the floor framing.</p>
<p>All hoses are fuel-rated.</p>
<p>Fuel flows to a Racor pre-filter and thence through the engine fuel pump and
filter on the starboard side of the engine.</p>
<p>Cooling sea-water flows from a water-intake filter to the engine through a
heat exchanger to a mixing elbow and silencer and exits via an anti-siphon loop
high in the stern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.3 </b><u><b>Electrical system (12v).</b></p>
</u>
<p>Power-sources:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>80-amp engine alternator.</p>
    <p>45w solar panel</p>
    <p>Ampair wind generator.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(Provision is also made for 240v &amp; 110v shore-power).</p>
<p>Power is stored in the following battery banks:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>One 12v battery dedicated to engine starting.</p>
    <p>Two 4D 6v heavy duty deep-cycle batteries in series storing a total of
    240 amps at 12v house power.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>All batteries are housed in lidded nylon/plastic boxes fixed permanently
below the quarter-berth astern of the navigation desk and adjacent to the
switching panel. All the batteries are securely tied down. The compartment
housing the batteries is vented by four stainless steel grilles.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="images/battbox.jpg" width="432" height="336"></p>
<p>A 10-amp shore-power battery charger is fitted.</p>
<p>Alternator output is controlled by a three-stage digital regulator.</p>
<p>A 360-amp battery switch is wired into the electrical system. The system also
includes an Echo-charge digital controller; this automatic charge-switching
device priority-charges the starter battery then automatically switches the
charge to the house bank without the need for manual intervention. By manual
switching of the battery switch it is equally possible to use the starter
battery to draw house current and the house bank for engine-starting, and to
switch off the entire system. The Echo-charge eliminates the danger to the
alternator of switching off the batteries with the engine still running.</p>
<p>The Ampair wind generator has a dedicated charge controller and the solar
panel a dedicated regulator, both fitted in the battery compartment.</p>
<p>Monitoring of the electrical system is by a Heart Interface (Link 10) digital
e-meter fitted over a 400ma shunt, enabling constant battery-state readings.</p>
<p>The electrical system is protected by a 250-amp main fuse. All sub-circuits
are individually fuse-protected.</p>
<p>Electrical wiring is tinned copper.</p>
<p>Main electrical distribution is via a panel with contact-breakers adjacent to
the navigation desk.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="images/panel.jpg" width="404" height="323"></p>
<p>Supply to the navigation instruments is direct from the house battery bank to
a positive and negative busbar in the navigation desk. Each circuit is
appropriately fused.</p>
<p>Main wiring diagram:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/wiring.jpg" width="501" height="396"></p>
<p>Manufacturer’s handbooks for all the above items and all items of
electrical equipment are kept on the vessel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.4. </b><u><b>Steering system.</b></p>
</u>
<p>Steering is by wheel mounted on a bronze pedestal bolted to the cockpit
floor. Connection to the rudder is via pulley and 5mm wire rope to a quadrant
attached to the rudder stock. Access for inspection and maintenance is via the
cockpit locker.</p>
<p>There is an emergency tiller which is fitted to the top of the rudder stock
through a screwed bronze deck plate.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="images/plate.jpg" width="423" height="341"></p>
<p>The Monitor wind-vane, when in use, is connected to the steering wheel by
ropes leading to a clutch fixed to the wheel. Manufacturer’s instructions on
use and maintenance are kept aboard the boat.</p>
<p>A 12v automatic helm is fitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.5. Gas system.</b></p>
<p>A stern locker isolated from the rest of the vessel and vented to atmosphere
from the bottom of the locker houses a propane/butane bottle and regulator. The
sole gas outlet is to the galley cooker via an unbroken, unjointed length of
crimped gas hose.</p>
<p>The flow of gas is dependent on a 12v solenoid situated in the gas locker and
controlled by a warning/detector panel in the galley. Gas is cut off if the 12v
power supply fails, either by manual switching or automatically by detection of
gas by the unit itself. A gas detector (valid for most combustible gases) is
fitted at floor level in the galley area. If gas is detected the system
automatically sounds a loud warning buzzer and shuts the gas system down by
cutting power to the solenoid.</p>
<p>The cooker has its own built-in flame failure system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.6. </b><u><b>Fire protection.</b></p>
</u>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vessel is fitted with two 2.25kg dry chemical fire extinguishers, one in
the forward compartment and one in the main saloon.</p>
<p>The engine compartment is fitted with flame-retardant insulation.</p>
<p>The galley compartment housing the gas cooker is lined on both sides, behind
and underneath with stainless steel sheet.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img border="0" src="images/cooker.jpg" width="460" height="364"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.7. </b><u><b>Navigation lights.</b></p>
</u>
<p>The vessel is fitted with red and green bow lights, mast running light and
stern white light. There is a masthead tricolour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.8. Discharge prevention.</b></p>
<p>A 15-gallon holding tank is fitted forward under the starboard settee in the
saloon. Discharge of the toilet is direct to the holding tank. It is not
possible to discharge the toilet directly to the sea. The holding tank can be
emptied via a Y-valve either by hand-pump (fitted inside the washbasin cabinet)
or by shoreside pump via the starboard deck fitting.</p>
<p>The holding tank is vented to the starboard cabin side</p>
