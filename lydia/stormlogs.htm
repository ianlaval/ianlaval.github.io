<p ALIGN="LEFT">Monday, June 2.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hello, Friends:</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Well, shortly after sending Saturday's jolly little message
about pleasant life aboard Lydia B on the ocean blue, we got our come-uppance
(which is the reason for the brevity of my last log entry.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shortly after I sent it off into the afternoon sunshine we were
overtaken by the MV Oleander, a freighter heading from Bermuda to Newfoundland.
Clearly himself a Newfie himself, going by his Irish-Canadian accent, he called
us on the VHF. For a chat, we thought. But it was really to ask if we were aware
of the weather ahead on our easterly track. 20-30 knots of wind and 8 -14 foot
seas east of N70, he said. Right on our doorstep. We'd be uncomfortable for a
night, then high pressure would build on the other side of this system. We felt
we could handle 20-30 knots of wind. Even 14-foot seas (though they really
wouldn't happen. Would they? Realists just wouldn't go voyaging).</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">That night we got caught in the strongest weather we ever want
to see. Southerly winds were soon screaming and seas building. We hove to,
already down to second (and last) reef and storm jib. The sight and the noise
were extraordinary. Big seas began to pile up, streaked with blown foam. Lydia
B, with its crew anxiously listening for sounds of moderation, spent the whole
night on her beam-ends, stationary except for a northerly drift of about 1.5
knots. Breaking waves regularly crashed over her. She was so far down that we
watched solid water flowing over the starboard portholes. How on earth could she
take it?</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">We got little sleep. It was a bleak time, in darkness. At first
light, with the storm still as hearty as ever, we tied ourselves to the boat and
crawled up the deck in driving rain to drag down the reefed main and get the
boat more upright. Then we did the same to the storm jib. Lydia B then lay
a-hull in more or less the same place, with the rudder lashed. Then we found
water lying in the turn of the bilge above the cabin sole and, unable to trace
the source -- the bilge itself was still dry -- we eventually sent out a
precautionary Pan-Pan on the HF radio, unsure if it had been heard. Then we
discovered that the boat had been pushed so far down hove-to that it had simply
spilled out of the bilge. It went back when we brought her upright.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">By this time Lydia B is in chaos below, everything moveable
having flown -- including a topless jar of coffee-creamer. Coffee-creamer turns
to toffee when sea-water is applied. It makes a wonderful slide on a varnished
cabin sole.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">A couple of hours after first light we got a call from Tony,
English skipper of 'Wings of Time', a 50-ft ketch about a mile from us, on
passage from Bermuda to Maine, NE USA. He'd clocked a wind of 61 knots during
the night, with the remainder steady at 50 knots. We know he's right. We
cancelled our Pan-Pan on the HF and got Tony to contact a ham radio colleague in
Bermuda to phone the coast guard in Canada and the US in case our original
message had been heard. It probably wasn't.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two hours later we put the still screeching southerly back on
Lydia's starboard beam, started the engine and motored back into the Gulf
Stream, still offering a 2.6-knot ride on our easterly heading. By now, the seas
had really risen to classic Atlantic height. We spent all yesterday rushing
along with current and wind -- we did the last 30 miles to 4.0am this morning
under bare pole, with neither engine nor sail power, but still running at up to
eight knots. Lydia's eight tons picked up and hoisted to the top of a newly
forming wave. Then the wave foams at its height, sometimes breaking, Lydia dips
her stern, then her bow goes down and she takes off downhill into the next
trough. Time and again a cross-wave chases Lydia, breaks on her gunwale and
crashes aboard, filling the cockpit (and occasionally knocking down Dave or
myself, tethered to the boat). The scene is impossible to describe. By then
there was blue sky and sun, so these gigantic waves, with foam-streaked troughs
between them something the size of a ski-run, and the height to match, were blue
too. Awesome's the word. And awesome that little Lydia B survived -- though we
felt constantly secure in her. She needs some tlc below (we probably don't smell
too sweet by this time either); her cockpit lee-cloths were torn to shreds by
the sheer force of the wind. We lost a few items blown out of the cockpit but
otherwise she's fit and well.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">It's been the toughest imaginable entry to offshore sailing for
Dave, who's had a bad dose of debilitating sea-sickness.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today the wind's calmed and we're sailing again, happy with five
docile knots and nearing the outer wall of the Gulf Stream. We're 560 nautical
miles out of the US east coast.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Love and best wishes</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ian and Dave,</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Lydia B.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hello, Friends:</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">N36.37, W063.43. 1604gmt Tuesday June 3.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, so many thanks for all your concerns and good wishes over
the last couple of days. We knew very few boats were near during the storm, but
were thankful to be in touch with you. Today it's sunny again, there's a warm
breeze of about ten knots on Lydia's starboard quarter and the ocean's back to
its familiar alluring, sparkling blue. We've both had sleep, are eating again
and are ambling along, still under storm jib and reefed main, at four or so
knots. The ocean's calming down. Seas are down to eight feet. It'll take a while
for the storm swell to subside.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">We're dropping south-east to get under 37 degrees North and out
of the influence of the series of low pressure systems that spawned our big one
two days ago. The barometer's already risen and we're coming under the influence
of the Azores high. When we've slipped another half degree south, to 36, we'll
head due east. From there we hear from Herb, an amateur who runs an HF radio net
daily for Atlantic sailors, that weather prospects for Europe-bound boats are
good at least until the end of the week.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, rather than pile on more sail immediately, we'll give
Lydia B the rest she deserves. And ourselves. We got no sleep and little food,
and are sore from banging about inside the lurching boat. Like living inside a
washing machine, said a colleague ashore.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The tally of loss and damage is small: a dinghy oar, outboard
fuel and a two-gallon can of water washed from the side decks. The lee cloths
shredded, a cockpit sheet bag gone and -- much the greatest loss -- the top of
my Nissan insulated mug, which got sucked out when the cockpit filled up. This
is serious. Tea and my Nissan are of major importance. No damage to the boat,
sails or rigging is evident; all the nav gear's working and the Monitor self-steering's
intact, save for a battered vane (I have three spares) -- though Dave spotted
and repaired a control line that had nearly chafed through in the storm.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">But how short is the memory! It was awesome while it lasted, and
looked like a place human beings shouldn't be. But Lydia B took care of us, we
must have done some right things and it's just great to be out here. Dave's
sea-sickness is on the wane, his confidence is rising in the light of experience
and we'll get cracking again shortly. As things stand we've maintained an
average of 110 miles daily and are content, even though the last 24 hours has
been fifty percent in a slightly less useful direction. We only want to get
there, not just fast. From here we understand better what drove Bernard
Moitessier as he described it in &quot;The Long Way&quot;. Not content with
completing a racing circuit of the world, he kept on going past the finishing
line, starting a second time round to everyone's consternation ashore. The
ocean's a box of questions and magical tricks. It's a pity so few people get to
look inside.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">More anon,</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Love and best wishes,</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ian and Dave.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">There's general agreement that we both probably stink by now,
but we're well fed, reasonably well rested and all's well aboard.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Love &amp; best wishes,</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ian &amp; Dave.</p>
